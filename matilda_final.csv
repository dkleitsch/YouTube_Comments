It is so fascinating how our body works and how technology is so advanced that people are able to get biologically for masculine or feminine! I genuinely found it so interesting. And the fact that someone (a transgender person) already went through what both a male feels and what a female feels biologically, and then you have the privilege to compare it cause you actually lived both‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so amazing!

14,"1. Your body did not ‚Äústop producing testosterone entirely‚Äù (like 0 nm of it), it just dropped to around as low a level as a female‚Äôs after you took blockers. The surgery doesn‚Äôt stop testosterone production in the body entirely, either. 
2. You weren‚Äôt getting PMS, since you cannot and will never be able to menstruate. That‚Äôs just flat out misinformation. The change in your emotional sensitivity changed because of the Estrogen (which makes humans more emotional in general since it affects theneurotransmitter systems in hormone such as serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in your brain).

24,"Dear Mathilda , I always love watching your videos. I'm a trans woman myself , 26 years old , have been on a regular dose of hormones from 19 to 21 and then I was forced by my family to switch to a low dose of HRT. I have been on low dose of HRT ever since. I'm 26 now , regularly get male fail , grew my hair out and was forced by my family to put social transition off. Now it has taken its toll on my mental health. I have a good job , I just finished a Ph.D. but I am not where I want to be. I realised a couple years ago that I need to go all the way to be happy with myself , just like you. You are one of the few trans women Youtubers I can relate to because I'm a straight trans woman myself , just like you. I am an outlier because most of us who knew as children are already fully transitioned for a long time at my age , so I am sad for all these years that I lost but better late than never. I hold hope because I have seen lots of successful transitions from women who transitioned after age 20 and I have good ingredients to work with : I'm 5 feet 5""6 and have a naturally feminine voice already. Just like you I want breast augmentation and SRS. I am most scared of dating post op. I am scared how a straight cis man will react when we hit it off and I will have to tell him that I had a male gender marker on my passport ID until the latter half of my 20s. I relate so much to you because we are around the same age and just like you I am a very chatty person who can go on and on for hours talking :D 
I also am very open about myself .
I love how society is becoming so much more tolerant towards girls like us as of lately.
I still have a long road to go but channels like yours give me hope for my future.
Much love and keep up the good work ü•∞",UgxwGCHEHSkUtz91boV4AaABAg,0,16,2022-03-31T23:37:51Z,none

84,Who knew that one day people would actually adopt the procedure that came from a pedophile Dr. Who did experiments on children . Especially since it turned out to be such a disaster. He was born and the Dr. Botched his circumcision and the Dr told his parents it's nurture not nature and he had a twin brother so making him a girl would be a perfect test . Well he ended up making them sleep together and he recorded it . The boy found out about what happened to him around age 14 and said he always knew he was a boy and change his name back to the original and started over as a true boy . Years later he killed himself and a while after that his twin killed himself too. The Dr also did other sick and twisted stuff on kids but it has nothing to do with transgender so I guess nature has something to do with it and a lot of people are now detrasisioning so if you want to be another gender be sure you really want it  and I would try everything else possible before you permanently mess around with your body.,UgxHbTAO3xQnONghLrt4AaABAg,0,0,2021-11-06T14:41:11Z,none

93,"I fear that while trying to portray your experience as transparent you neglect to inform the viewer on the full risks of what you're doing to yourself and your body. You're not telling the full story, and portraying it from the perspective of almost pseudo encouragement by saying it was the answer to your dismorphia. This video could easily mislead and harm children and naive adults, please reconsider your approach. Your complaints are about your innate masculine features and by complaining about what the therapy did in a damaging way, it insinuates how that damage helped correct your look to be more feminine. Not everyone will have the same feminizing effects taking hormone therapy, some men might just get male pattern baldness and more visceral fat, some men might end up losing the cartilage inbetween their bones. Just because you ended up getting fat in ""all the right places"" for your goals doesn't mean that will happen to all. To pretend that the side effects of your treatment happened as they should and that all hormone replacement and therapy will lead to desired results is a lie at best, and intentionally misleading at worst.

You're pretending that the few things you do complain about are the biggest risks, yet you refrain from sharing any other traumatic responses to hormone therapy like astigmatism, infertility, bone density degregation, increase in cancer risk, damaged immune system, hypo/hyper thyroidism and blood disease.

Like so many others in this community, your explanation of your therapy is completely focused on the visual and cosmetic, rather than the intrinsic and internal affects done to you. You're playing a game with your words, and while you may not intend it, these are the consequences. You are not a medical doctor, nor are you qualified to talk about your ""experience"" in an educational way. Your ""honesty"" is harmful.

115,"I am a Christian. A Man of Christ, and biblical doctrine.

Jesus once said that if it were not for a whore who helped a fleet of Christians escape the wrath of a tyrant who was killing all Christians or Jews that stowed these two men away, than there wouldnt be much of a Church today.

He basically meant that discrimination is not a thing in his life.

With that being said.

Personal preferences are a direct result of standards that are enforced and the way that they are enforced be it good (functional) standards... or bad (dysfunctional) standards have a great impact on how a person interprets themselves and everyone else around them.

Its not all that clear if what you have done to yourself is wrong....

However, I think that in a since now that you are infact a woman, there is nothing wrong with being a woman.

I think what you have done is forgivable, it does not seem there is anything against this so long as you take responsibility for yourself the way that you are now.

I still think that our points of views are often a result of how standards are imposed over us.

Like for example.

I had a very hard headed Christian family whom I dont think are very Christ like.

Their very deceitful hypocrites who are very proud and shallow who love their comfort more than God.

They themselves are unforgiving...

I was always small, weak, and silly.

As a boy, this made very narrow minded people view me as being too much like a girl.

Even I believe that I would have fit in better as a girl.

My personality was always hyper sun shine happy and sinsitive and weak...

But, I recognized myself as a boy...

It was the rest of the world that beat in the idea that Im not man enough to be a man...

If that wasnt bad enough, I was molested as a small boy by an older boy.

I felt further and further feminised.

I dont feel what you feel exactly....

I feel like my body isnt man enough or beautiful enough for attracting woman.

I feel beside myself in my own skin.

And everyones Idea of the word Man is so steriotypical.

Im a Man, not a God.

I bleed, I bend, I break, Im not invencible...

Sometimes, because of all the pressure...

I just wish I was a woman just for a little while....

So I can be loved or ignored and people would expect less of me...

Id rather be the supporting nurturing character not the lead honcho who carries the whole world on his shoulders....

Everything is so heavy to be a man....

And Im so small....

And Im just that piece that just doesnt fit in all the gooves just right...

I think your pretty and if thats the direction you want to go in, I wont judge...

You look extremely attractive and your true to yourself.

Its not like your Gay.

Your a straight woman...

You have all the right parts and your body is clearly a womans body....

I accept you the way you are.

There is no reversing it so you may as well just own it.... Its who you are...

I dont think Jesus hates you...

I think he feels youve corrected it one way or another...

After all... he said if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out...

Clearly your body was causing you to sin...

So, you plucked it out...

You made a correction.

Your lovable, and sweet.

I like you.",UgzTzkpfMgKzCMTp3P14AaABAg,1,1,2021-09-25T16:39:34Z,none

I also wonder why the medical community denies millions of women hormone replacement while young men can get massive doses of estrogen and progesterone.

368,"So, I can't obviously speak for everyone, but the thing you say at 2:50 : Where I work most females are either as tall as me or taller (and I am 5ft 6.9"", which is the average height for females seen in 2018) and I have gone through boy puberty fully.
I've actually had some people (men and women, though it's ""funnier"" when women ask it when they are already outside if the average height range seen in most females) ask me if I would not like to be a little bit taller because ""well, I mean, you are not like, supertall"" (Dutch people are among the tallest in the world, so that might be one of the reasons for asking this).
And I have also had people who are confused, which, most of the time people tend to be just for someone being transgender, but because they don't get how I managed to stay short.
The point I'm trying to make: try to keep biological diversity in the back of your head when you think about this.
(This also goes out to people who like to place certain ""biological traits"" usually observed mostly in men under an insane magnifying glass when they meet someone who they know is a transfemale and like to emphasize all the things ""that make that you can tell she was born male"", because even if someone is slender while tall and born female and identifies with the sex assigned at birth, you will hear absolutely no one about someone's height in the way you can hear people discuss someone's height when being a transfemale).",UgzjYHW2nx-TCqwRthN4AaABAg,0,0,2020-12-05T20:48:12Z,none

When the body doesn't produces hormones and you stop them, it may be like a menopause in the beginning.

Please take care ! And NEVER stop them. If you want a menopause, you need to lower your dosage. Stopping means suicide

671,HRT doesn't work for everyone in the same way.. I started HRT in my 20's back in the late 1990's and have had little to no physical effects from it.. However it did help me mentally cope with being trans just physically I got no response from it.. Over the years I have been to three different Endo's and they really don't know why.. They just remind me that everyone reacts differently to HRT.. At first I was on Premerin - Spirno then later Estradiol - Spirno - Progestrone.. Done pills.. patches.. injections.. Sometimes I think my body is just missing something that makes it responsive to HRT.. However as I said it has helped me a lot mentally which is why I have chosen to stay with it.,UgxD8X7SUYVaEVJDqRp4AaABAg,1,16,2020-06-06T11:04:08Z,none

890,"I'm a newbie trans who's FtM. I came here mostly out of curiosity, and to educate myself, but now I can't stop thinking about how frustrating being trans is. I'm hourglass shaped, have very full perfectly shaped breasts, my voice literally has not changed whatsoever from childhood and is super soft and high pitched even by female standards- I have everything girls see as desirable and before I knew I was trans, no one understood how I could possibly have such intense body image issues especially since pre-puberty, I didn't give a single damn about how I looked. Now I just look at my perfectly healthy beautiful female body and wish it was given to someone it fit and could keep it exactly the way it is without feeling so horrible all the time. I almost feel bad for ruining it, especially since it's so futile I know I probably won't ever be comfortable in my own skin, because the one thing hormones don't help an 18 years old with is height and I'm stuck being 4'8"" my entire life.",UgxJSeZtPu89gmytPzx4AaABAg,6,13,2020-02-24T08:09:16Z,none
