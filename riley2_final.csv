It's women like you that make our society less afraid of people who are different than them.
So, once again- thank you! I learn from your videos so much.
When I first met a trans person that didn't came out to her parents yet, I really didn't know how to address to them. It took time for me and I was really afraid to say something that might hurt them.
I could use these videos than. But I didn't.

45,"You are so, so articulate. Thank you for the work you did in making this video and for making a person questioning their gender not feel out of place because I haven't necessarily seen someone with the same exact story as mine. I haven't really seriously thought about my gender before I guess... But suddenly I've started experiencing gender dysphoria at the age of 21 while never experiencing it before at any point in my life that I can remember, and now I'm looking back and like my favorite songs in middle school were Androgyny and Cherry Lips by Garbage, which both definitely deal with trans themes imo. I'm thinking maybe I just never seriously thought about my gender before until like a month ago so I never really thought it might not be best for me? Until I started thinking about how much better I'd feel in social situations being a woman... So I think I've always had the euphoria (when I was little I used to 'play ballet' in my room with piano music), I just never put two and two together that what I really enjoyed in doing those activities  was the idea of filling a (very stereotypical) social role of what I thought it meant to be a woman back then. As I grew up those activities were kind of stamped out of me by my family, relatives, and church, so I really honestly forgot I could experience those feelings because I was always perceived as being a man. I just always felt like there was something missing, I mean if I am a man (ugh I hate this process) then I'm gay, so I thought that that was what I was missing, but I still would just have these deep-seated angers at random points about having to engage with strangers and friends as a man in every social situation and it was getting tiresome. I shoved it down as far as I could and would hang out with pretty bro-ish people (even though I didn't act super broey myself), even during college tho I expanded my circles to more feminine-presenting people then and realized that I was missing out on a lot of fun just being able to be myself 100%.

Now two things are making me start to experience this childhood gender euphoria I almost forgot about... 1. is my hair. The more I've grown it out the more I feel... just... right. Like I never noticed there was something off but now that I'm experiencing it there is something definitely off. And 2. is trying makeup. Once I started putting it on (with some friends) I just felt like this intense happiness that I was doing something to present as more feminine. Since these things are happening that might be why I'm ""suddenly"" experiencing dysphoria?

And I'm not even sure still if I am a woman 100%",UgxCJfLVT_YuRGaQdkB4AaABAg,0,5,2019-10-31T05:46:17Z,none

97,"Not sure if I missed this point in the video, but if anyone could help, I would really appreciate it! My ex has publicly come out as trans, changed their name and identifies trans masculine(to my knowledge, we are not in contact so all this is from FB and common friends). But during our relationship, I called them my girlfriend. Now, when I talk about this relationship and my experience within it(in therapy, with friends who bring it up, relatives etc), I am not sure how refer to them. Obviously I use the correct pronouns(they/them) and real name(correcting friends who use their dead name) but this term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô still slips out as for during most of the relationship I viewed them as a woman and we were a ‚Äòlesbian couple‚Äô and therefore I am not sure how to replace it. I don‚Äôt want to say boyfriend because as someone who dates multiple genders it just doesn‚Äôt feel right(doesn‚Äôt honour my sexual fluidity and experiences) and terms like partner seem too serious for the nature of our relationship. Of course mostly I just use the term ex, but especially when I tend to talk about my own sexuality and experiences the term girlfriend is easiest to determine the nature of this specific relationship. To clear up, they did begin questioning and partly transitioning at the end of our relationship and then my ex still preferred me calling them by the term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô.

Not sure if that made any sense, but I appreciate any help as I want to learn how to be a better ally and, regardless of our differences, respect my ex and their gender.

102,"On names: I've seen a lot of the older trans people (like me) change to something either close to their name, or with the same initials, along those lines. For instance, I know I Maureen who is now Mor, a Brian Laurence who is Brenda Lauren. With me, Christopher changed to Christyanne allows me to still use Chris, a name that I'm used to, and I'm too old and crotchety to get used to a new one. I changed my middle name far away from its old one, though, and the second part of my first gets close to what I would have called myself if I'd changed younger: Anna.",Ugz7JV5sFzwTkzIDgZB4AaABAg,0,22,2019-08-19T00:49:48Z,none

109,"I think Contrapoints has talked in a few of her videos about being trans without experiencing body dysphoria. 

Which makes me really not understand the people who accuse her of being a trans medicalist- of course she knows what it‚Äôs like to be trans without dysphoria- she‚Äôs talked about it pretty extensively. She‚Äôs said that she transitioned because she knew she would be happier, because she wasn‚Äôt happy with her gender. And while there were some elements of dysphoria (she‚Äôs also talked about realising that if she didn‚Äôt transition, she‚Äôd have to grow old as a gender that didn‚Äôt fit, and that was extremely uncomfortable for her), she‚Äôs also said that she doesn‚Äôt have specific dysphoria relating to her body. 

I would recommend her videos as well, though it‚Äôs important to understand she often engages in dialectic argument through characters, neither of which necessarily reflect her view. And she often delves into the philosophy of things, which doesn‚Äôt always reflect the reality of many trans folk. It‚Äôs still an interesting way to get some more viewpoints though.",UgwFiN8QKYuRls1AAY94AaABAg,1,4,2019-08-18T21:11:02Z,none
