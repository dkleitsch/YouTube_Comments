"I know it's not ""cool"" to comment on old videos, but I just wanted you to know that I am starting T next month!! My mom is fully supportive, but wants to know more about being trans in general, so I sent her this playlist. Also, thank you so much for having it all captioned because she's deaf. I appreciate these videos SO much and they helped me learn a lot about being trans and helped me come to the realization that transitioning is right for me.

Big/deep topic to speak on would be.... How to explain being tran/nonbinary in a better way to children. Being able to help them understand the difference between what you were assigned at birth and your gender. I have a 6 and 5 year old and my son absolutely thinks short hair is only for boys and long hair for girls. I want to help him understand better than. Poppa was a girl and now feels best as a boy.,Ugz1b1SAJZmsIa8uJFV4AaABAg,0,0,2021-12-15T00:11:56Z,1

"Thank you for this. As a mother of of 32 yo. Newly coming out person, I am trying to learn everything that I can. I am TERRIFIED for my adult child. I also have ALWAYS wanted the ( biological sex ) person that they have been to date. So, there is a LOT of grief that will need to be worked through. ( The greatest being that they have suffered 32 years w/o feeling the freedom to share.) So, not all of us are Haters. We are just stunned, reeling, attempting to be supportive and grappling with or own mental health at the same time.

"Thank you so much for this video, Chase! I am trying to explain  the transgender experience is to my  Chinese immigrant family. My parents have come a long way but it is still difficult to bridge the gap of their generation and traditions with us American born kids. We have someone who is transitioning right now and I would really like my family to gain more empathy so they don't alienate him. I am sending them this video so they aren't bombarding him with questions or making judgements without being educated first. This is such a clear, concise video so I'm hoping this video will get the message across even though their English isn't perfect.

"My child came out to me as trans about a month ago, and I agree, every situation is different. I grew up very much feeling that I had the lgbtq's back. As a teenager I boycotted a local movie theater because they wouldn't let us see an (unrated) comedy about lesbians because we were underage. I did my senior high school project on crossdressers. When one of my girls came out to me as bi (age 10), I celebrated her bravery in speaking about something difficult. When my older daughter came out as lesbian and later genderfluid, I was likewise relatively unfazed. However, when that same genderfluid daughter eventually came out to us as trans, suddenly I found myself confused and a bit ashamed of my own reaction. As well as one of acceptance and unconditional love, it was also one of loss and conflicting emotions. I never would have thought pronouns would make a big deal, but for some reason they're a mental hurdle that's been difficult to get used to. Also, I spent a long time and a lot of love picking out an original and feminine name, and now he goes by the commonest male name I can think of. Probably the hardest thing has been trying to understand the identity of someone who grew up female and identifies as male. It  threw me into a state of reexamination of what parts of his personality were really his and which parts were based on my perception of him. As an ally to the community, I felt like a failure for not being able to understand or identify. One of my friends gave me sh*t about my mixed reactions too which hurt me. It's different when it's a child you've borne than when you're speaking about a community at large. My family is super supportive too, which is great, but to a degree I want to fight to defend his honor -- but there's no one among my family to fight. It's another part of why it's been hard -- trying to fight an imaginary enemy. I know he's run into some hard times with his peers, and that's not good, and I get that, but nothing within the family. I asked him to talk with me the other day about being trans, and he rolled his eyes and said, ""yeah, Mom, I know what you're going to say, that you love me and support me no matter what."" I said, ""yes, but you have to understand it's hard for me, harder than I  thought, and I hope you'll forgive me if I hurt your feelings or don't understand. I will do my best, and of course I do love and support you, but I'm having a harder time dealing with it than I thought I would."" To both my ex-husband and me, he has said that he'll go back to being our little girl if we want him to, which honestly has made the situation even more difficult. So I'm learning everything I can.",Ugy0dPkl7XAGnykMHyh4AaABAg,0,0,2021-08-17T03:16:42Z,1

"Is gender dysphoria an at all similar feeling to body dysmorphia? I know it's not the same but I have a long history of anorexia but have gained weight in order to pursue my dream to become a doctor but I feel like my body is too big, there are bits of my body that I wish didn't exist and I wish like I could cut them off. Also when people say I'm not fat I can't believe them because my anorexia knows that I am. Obviously this is different because my logical, medical student brain knows that I am not overweight but for trans people, they are absolutely correct in their beliefs about their gender, but I was just wondering if any of these feelings might be somewhat similar",UgwA2WiUXpRk2nA3lux4AaABAg,2,1,2021-08-03T13:33:58Z,1

"Fun Facts: You are not a man. You were not born in a mans body. You don't know what its like to be a man. You will never know what its like to be a man. You will never be a man. If you're unhappy with who you are, getting a dick sewed on will not change that. Just because you take testosterone and say ""bro"" doesn't mean you're a dude. Being a guy is a lot more than tv characteristics and looks. Its one thing to relate to a characteristic of a male character you see on a tv show, but to reduce men to what you see on TV or in Mens magazines as the flawed ""definition"" of a man is shallow and to try and convince yourself that 'hey yeah, i can do that or act that way' will make you no more of a man that you already are.",UgzcDVkpzbGFGamfja14AaABAg,2,1,2021-05-18T14:07:50Z,1

"Im so glad i saw this video. I kinda understand a bit more, but i see theres other things i should learn to actually fully understand. Im a CIS male; he, his, him.. i like being male, but just cuz im male doesnt mean i HAVE to like what a MALE has to like, such as; sports, color blue, etc, but i do enjoy sports, art, and a variety of things. Everyone is different i get that, i just didnt have such an open mind as i thought i did, cuz this is complicated, stuff i didnt even think about. Anyways.. i guess im kinda questioning myself now... and idk why, cuz i do like being MALE. When i was younger, i have this very early memory that when i ran, i ran like a ""girl"" i thought. And i liked to pretend i had long hair, and when i played with dolls i always chose the FEMALE version dolls. People noticed this and made me feel very insecure. As i grew up i tried to change that cuz of what they said about me. But i do like being a MALE, so im way confused haha. I'll have to keep searching for knowledge, but i know itll be a while to do so, cuz im lazy to even click buttons, or mind tireness.

"For any Transpeople out there: Are you okay with people completely denying your former gender or should I acknowledge the gender you 'were' before if I talk about a past event? (I know someone and speaking of our childhood memories I'm never really sure if I should say him or her, since at that time he was in a girls body.) Also is the fact that you used to be in a different body 'important' to you, since you spend a huge part of your life in it

"For most of my life I've believed myself to be female. With some exceptions. I dont like using feminine pronouns -- I can ignore it but when I hear them in reference to me I get kind of uncomfortable. And I hate any sort of reference to ""female"" genitalia or ""female"" sexuality. Even when I was a kid I would say I barely counted as a woman, or that I was a failure of a girl because I wasn't feminine much at all. And though I have long hair,  to me it seems more masculine, like a metal heads long hair rather than a girls long hair. I don't like looking at my face and I'm most comfortable with people using thr male nickname for my name.

But at the same time, some days I'm more comfortable with looking feminine. And I like my breasts. I just hate anything below the belt. And it makes it really hard figuring out where I lie on the gender spectrum",Ugy8tRqq9dbI_5side54AaABAg,1,0,2017-08-16T20:43:45Z,1

"Another Example To Explain Social Dysphoria To A Cis Person Is To Take Something That They Identity As Very Strongly And Imagine That Noone Believes You. So For Example, If Someone Really Values Being An Honest Person, Ask Them To Imagine EVERYONE Saying They Were A Liar, Introducing Them To Others As ""The Liar"" And Every Time The Person Tells People They're Not Lying, Them Being Told They're Wrong, It Just Proves They're Lying And Maybe Even Getting Into Trouble For It.

"I am a cis woman. I have PCOS, which is a hormonal disorder that means I have higher levels of testosterone than is normal for women. This causes changes in the body, like male pattern hair growth, acne, weight gain, amenorrhea. Sometimes that makes me feel utterly shitty about my body and myself, even suicidal.

"As a cis, the best way that one of my friend (who is trans) explained it to me was: Imagine that you woke up the next morning with ""male genitals"" (if you're a cis woman) or ""female genitals"" (if you're a cis man). You look in the mirror and the body that you see doesn't match who you are. Now imagine that you went to the store and the cashier said, ""thank you ma'am"" or ""thank you sir"" and you knew they were wrong but nobody else saw you the way that you felt. And you had to navigate through life with people assuming you were something that you weren't. Essentially, if you woke up looking like a female then you wouldn't suddenly identify as a woman; you'd still be the same person. Now I've educated myself more on the subject and know that there's a lot more to it then that and that I will never completely understand but it was a breakthrough for me when it came to beginning to understand more.",UgxK4n8EEBHrAkeSUpJ4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-02T02:27:30Z,1

That as a cis person we cannot actually 100% understand how someone that's trans feels, but we can try and mentally grasp the concepts that they are trying to share with us, and believe that what they tell us about how they feel is true.

"Some criticism: I agree with your general ideas but there are a few scenes I disagree with, or rather, would have worded differently. For example, the use of ""feel"", ""identify"", ""percieve"", ""gender identity"" and ""gender"". It's best not to use the words identify and feel because we don't identify or feel a gender. The only way you can feel male or female is the roles assigned, however we can generally ""feel"" that our sex is wrong, which is actually just dysphoria. I think it's best to not use the words gender or gender identity either  because they both refer to the social and cultural roles assigned to men and women, gender identity being which role you identify with the most and how you express that. As trans people, we know that this is not the case for us but we have been lead to believe that gender and gender identity is when our outside doesn't match the inside. However this description is inaccurate as gender has never referred to this, it's always referred to the social aspect. It would be much better to state that our sex does not match with who we are inside, hence dysphoria rather than our ""gender"". As you stated, this has nothing to do with gender non-conformity and by using the term gender, it just reinforces the idea that if you do not conform to your gender role, you are trans.",Ugx0RP4f7wMslAYBNwt4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-01T22:27:10Z,1

You're in the changing room with them, and they're forcing a sweater on you, but it's way too small, and way too thin. You've been eyeing another sweater the whole trip, and it looks wonderful, but Society is telling you that you can't have that one. You decide to try it on anyway, and it's comfy and warm and fits just right. Society is telling you over and over that it looks ugly and isn't right and it's too expensive and you might change your mind, but you buy it anyway, and it's absolutely perfect.

That's what being trans is like. You have this unexplainable knowledge that the jumper you were given just does not fit, and society is telling you all these lies about what you should and shouldn't do, but there's nothing you want more than that sweater and you just KNOW you have to have it. You can't hide it away or pretend it doesn't exist. It's an inescapable part of who you are.",Ugjh9pAGZDq-33gCoAEC,3,164,2017-08-01T23:56:09Z,1

I just want to leave maybe a more nuanced comment about what you said about ""it's when your outside doesn't match your inside"" : as a trans person, i believe that my outside matches my inside, because I'm non binary and my body isn't inherently gendered (since gender is a social construct). It's society that associate my appearance with being a woman, but my body is not inherently ""a woman's body""; it's just a body. And this association body <=> woman makes me feel bad and feel dysphoria. That's just my experience, and not every trans person feel this way, but I wanted to highlight this as the narrative of ""born in the wrong body"" is in my opinion a simplistic and reductive description of being trans and I wouldn't recommend to use it even in trans 101 as it perpetuates cissexist ideas about bodies (I'm not saying that Chase said ""born in the wrong body"" I'm just giving more details because ""your inside doesn't match your outside"" could easily make people think ""oh they're born in the wrong body then"").",Ugg6lrvuTRDGIngCoAEC,9,10,2017-08-01T12:23:09Z,1

"Hey chase, you said something about that us trans people often try to find validation by other people by them calling us the right pronouns, and that it might be a little problematic, but i dont think thats the reason why we want everyone to call us the right pronouns. I think its more like that we are for example male and we want other people to call us male; because we are. Not because we want to feel good about ourselves and feel valid, but just because we _are_. I dont want people to call me he because like lets say, they wanna make me feel good, like ""oh you feel like a boy let me be nice to you and call you he"". Its more like just with cis people we dont call them the right pronouns to validate them but just simply because those _are_ their pronouns.

"In my experience people found it harder to adjust to different pronouns than to a new name, even after my friends had gotten used to my new name and never messed that up they'd still get the pronouns wrong sometimes, I think that might be because they were thinking more about the name whereas pronouns are just automatic, we don't really think about them before we say them usually. 
It sucks when someone uses the wrong pronouns, but if I know they're trying and just made a mistake I don't mind nearly as much, especially if they correct themselves. 
Also I totally agree on not making a big deal of apologising, a quick sorry is good, but I'd rather no apology that a massive declaration about it.

"I remember going to a rally for my church youth group, and when we got back, my sponsor commended and thanked me for being so insistent and good about reminding/informing people on how to refer to me when it came to pronouns. At the rallies, you're split up into family groups, and the groups will be mixes of all the chapters. My sponsor was put in a group with a young trans boy, and any time they used ""she"" or ""her,"" the kid would just look annoyed. He didn't actually say ""please refer to me as male,"" he just expected everyone to know. Please, PLEASE don't do this. Don't expect people to know right away how to treat you. It's like expecting a doctor to know you're allergic to a certain medicine without telling them (okay maybe not that extreme, but you get it). Even if you're shy and don't feel comfortable speaking out like this, please don't be mad at people for making this mistake. They don't know they're making the mistake.

I think it's a matter of the mind most of the time. It's really reconditioning yourself to use the proper words. Your tip actually helped me out. I think you mentioned it in the Your So Brave podcast some episodes ago, and honestly I haven't made the mistake of misgendering them since then.
Also, I found that the best way to find out how to handle accidentally misgendering someone is by doing what you said: apologizing real quick on the spot and correct yourself, but I also think one should talk to the person on the side later and have a conversation on how they prefer you handle it. Communication goes a long way.",UgwIMjblCw84qP6n-eZ4AaABAg,1,0,2017-08-08T05:12:34Z,1

"Another thing on disrespecting people's pronouns when you're mad at them: It makes it seem like a privilege to have the correct pronouns used. Like i'm good with you right now so i'll call you by what you want. But now i'm mad at you so you don't deserve the right pronouns. It also can make the person who is trans afraid to fight back because they know that if they say something against you, you'll hurt them emotionally by using the other pronouns/birth name. So if you're hurting them they won't say anything so that they don't get hurt more. This can be really damaging to their mental state.",Ugz3SgcjzRKHZqb5CNB4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-07T05:10:40Z,1

"What about other pronouns besides he, they, or she? I have multiple people in my life (ages ranging from 15-45) who use ze/zir or ze/hir pronouns. I think its really important now to educate about pronouns outside of the binary. And since they/them pronouns are more well-known now, we need to start talking about other pronouns. I use they/them pronouns and its definitely more difficult for the people in my life who use ze/zir or ze/hir pronouns because its less known and people respect it even less, thinking that its a ""made up word"". All language is made up. All language has been developed in order to reflect our social world. Language is constantly evolving. All pronouns should be respected if those pronouns resonate with that person. A lot of people don't know how to use ze/zir pronouns and use ""they"" as a replacement. ""They"" is not that persons pronouns, so take the time to learn how to use ze/zir or whatever other pronoun that person goes by. Also, one of our trans elders, Leslie Feinberg, used ze/hir pronouns.

""It's important to gender a person correctly so they feel they pass as the gender.""

In the event the person does not pass and in public the person is misgendered, how do you feel this situation should be handled? Also, if a trans person asks, ""do I pass,"" is it ok to tell them ""no,"" in the event they don't yet pass (of course using the proper pronouns regardless)? I work with trans kids, many who don't pass, but constantly asked, ""do I pass?"" I personally feel honesty is important here to not set them up for disappointment in ""the real world.""

About misgendering when your angry at someone. Another reason and perhaps the main one for me that it is a huge taboo thing to do is that you are not just insulting the person you are angry at when you do it. In my mind you invalidate one you invalidate everyone. Just don't. Find other ways to be angry with someone sure. It happens.

I want to give a representation of pronouns as far as my life. I've literally been misgendered sense infancy. My mom has always corrected people that I was male sense I could remember. Growing up I used to do the same thing until I got older when I stopped correcting people about my pronouns. I've answered to both pronouns and I've used both pronouns to describe myself. I've embraced both pronouns because I'm seen as both pronouns. The empowerment comes from the correct usage of pronouns. In the beginning of my life I can understand how pronouns really do effect yo as a child growing up and why the correct pronouns gives affirmation and validation to that individual. It's always phenomenal to be called your correct pronouns and it's confirmation that your being supported. With neutral pronouns I've personally not used them yet because I've not met a gender neutral person but I welcome them when I do meet them. üòä,Ugy4WYKbnDrTYPCB0rx4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-05T16:09:14Z,1

"I think your honesty here is really amazing, I feel like people get so scared they're going to offend others by not getting pronouns correct straight away, so often they don't even try. So letting people know that it's natural to slip up, especially if you've known that person for a long time, is so helpful. As long as you respectfully correct yourself it's okay, and it's nice to show that person that you are making a conscious effort to use their correct pronouns, you just slipped up a little this time; it's okay it happens to a lot of people, even those within the community, we're not all magical pronoun unicorns, although that would be amazing ü¶Ñüåà",UgyxRyyrVXvNF1ut4Td4AaABAg,0,7,2017-08-05T13:26:03Z,1

"Important:

Purposely misgendering a trans person because you are annoyed at them / dislike them is never acceptable. It is transphobic. Using someone's pronouns correctly is not an act of kindness - it's just something you do.
If you were annoyed at a cisgender man, you wouldn't call him ""she"", would you? So don't do it with a transgender man.
It's not just offensive to that person, but to the entire transgender community, as it shows you only respect trans people's identities when you want to and shows that you think correct pronouns are something transgender people have to earn.

Ask any man, cis included, whether they can pee sitting down, and you'll either receive a ""yes"" or they're super toxic and think men aren't allowed to (but they're still physically capable).

I've always been very tomboyish my whole life such as cutting my hair like a boy. I felt happy when someone mistakes me for a boy. I remember seeing boys being friends when i was like 6 and thinking it would be cooler and better to be a boy. It was always sorr of nagging me.

"I would like to say I think the assigned at birth gender in some cases is right until they suffer some trauma so there are those I don't believe are born a certain gender and some who had more masculine as a assigned at birth female who is a male really. Its a different for all, some its genes or chemical exposure in childhood or by parents before they were born, some like myself (I was ok being a girl for awhile but after enduring abuse or threats on my life simply because I was a girl and they were obsessed with me or stalking me, when I felt suffciated I became non-binary because I felt afraid to have a gender, I wanted to be seen as something desirable for mind alone and people get too fixated on genders and straight bi, pan, gay, queer, etc labels I just wanted to be see as a person just a person. I do not think Jammi was born to stay a girl at all, even as a teen in that old pic he looked a little odd, like he was a boy dressed up not a girl really, so I think its just soemthing his dna gave him, too much masculine hormones in the womb or whatever but there are a variety of reasons a person becomes a transitioning person, and all are equally legitimate reasons (unless its like my therapist told me about with the one man who was so distraught about the death of his only relative his mother that he wanted to become her in essence but I have been in a lot of therapy and only once heard of a situation liek that therapist mentioned, that is why its important to seek therapy and advice from those who have experience in their own life with this kind of situation, however I bless you all and hope that no one for whatever reasons is denied the right to be who they need to be. Much love to all and I wish you all as easy and gentle a transition or change of gender in terms only whichever is able to travel whichever their path may be, and its not just abut happiness but often a relief of a feeling of being wrong with what your outside depicts. Sorry if this doesn't make sense I wrote this  when I hadnt had much sleep and I don't have a good grasp of English anymore since an accident years ago brought me brain injury anyway just meant to say some of us are not born this way but it doesnt make our journey any less valid or real.

It‚Äôs not like your new penis is functional. It doesn‚Äôt look like a male penis, it doesn‚Äôt ejaculate, you cannot stimulate it by touching it, etc.

If your partner wants to have intercourse, just strap on a strapon.

"Interesting.  I'm impressed by the presenter and his frank, comfortable and confident attitude.  That said, I still don't completely 'get' it, and the whole process still seems artificial to me - despite best effort of modern science, the transformation is still more pretend than real at the end of the day.  If it truly makes a person better able to live with themselves and to find whatever version of their 'best life' that's possible - then I'd say* fine - but I still think, without getting graphic,  it would hard to find a compatible partner.  *No, I shouldn't get a say, but when this is essentially taxpayer funded, one does begin rethink the position.

"@Jammidodger and anyone else who has an opinion on this:
A couple disclaimers
1. I am not trans
2. I am ignorant on this topic and that's why I would appreciate some opinions on it. Although I understand that the research behind the surgeries are extensive and after watching a couple of medical videos on it, it seems pretty safe (as safe as like the opposite like a hysterectomy)

3. I know this is a very complicated topic and it depends on the person, but...

I was wondering what your opinion on what age transgender people should be able to give consent getting this surgery?
Is there already a minimum age requirement?

An additional disclaimer:
4. If and when I decide I want children and one or all of them figure out that they are trans (or a part of the LGBTQ community in general, I want to support them in any way possible) the same way with something like a tattoo (which is more of a form of an expression than dealing with constant dysphoria), I don't want my kid to commit to something that they might regret in the future.

AND...although I‚Äôve consciously made an effort not to be hung up on size, I did date a guy whose penis was just tooooo small. It was like a pencil....one of those golf card marking kind of pencils.

I'll tell you why:
1) you don't make these videos to be helpful
2) you make these videos to get a rise out of people, or to just plain get attention.
3) you like to talk on public videos about your pseudo-penis because you are a just plain inappropriate person who likes to talk about his penis in public videos for all the world to see.
4) you make these videos, talking all about your penis, BECAUSE YOU ARE ON AN ADDICTIVE DRUG aka Testosterone, which makes you OVERSEXED and probably an addict like NoahFinnce and your oversexed addicted life will be a total wreck in a few years.",UgzOm18x5a-7AqUm9L94AaABAg,11,0,2020-06-30T02:41:58Z,1

"So like seemingly everyone here, I have no idea why YouTube recommended this to me. I'm a cis guy, last time I was interested in LGBTQ+ issues was at least a year ago, and my trans friends can be counted on one hand - Safe to say, I am not the main demographic for this kind of content.

But I'm so glad that it _is_ being recommended. YouTube has a bad habit of half-hiding content they deem ""non-advertiser friendly"", so a lot of videos regarding transgendered and homosexual people isn't being seen by those who need it, such as young LGBT-identifying folks.

Overall, your channel seems like a great resource for those who need it, and I'm glad YouTube is allowing it to be seen :)",Ugz1E9FQSkJKM1bzmNZ4AaABAg,8,1106,2020-05-05T22:54:21Z,1
"Wow! I am, happily, shocked the NHS pays for all the surgery of transitioning! Here in the US with our shyt health ""insurance"" I believe it's considered ""unnecessary"" and therefor the patient has to pay for everything, which I heard is a shocking amount. Thanks for answering everyone's questions so frankly without any apologies or embarrassment. I've been queried by friends on sex questions, and have always been honest, open, and unembarrassed. Too many people in our society are freaked out about questions about sex and sexuality instead of handling it like a matre adult. People just generally want to know because they are curious, don't know, just exploring etc., so it's really not big deal-- in the right setting. I'm against people springing questions on famous grand people about their genitals, I mean I don't ask how a cis person's genitals look like, why in an interview would one just feel free to ask an trains person and yet it still is an often asked question, like its normal, like asking how one's day is...

"I watch so many of Jamis videos and honestly if I hadn‚Äôt watched his transformation video I would have NEVER thought he was trans. Like I would argue about it and bet money that he was born male. His voice, looks, just everything fits him so perfectly!. Before I didn‚Äôt understand how trans people really felt, I felt for them my heart would ache hearing stories of how they feel. I can‚Äôt watch too much of RuPauls drag race because all of their stories are so sad and I just sit there and cry with them. After watching jamis videos I realized THIS is what everyone means by they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfit‚Äù or that wasn‚Äôt them being their gender. Jami is a boy and was meant to be a boy just like the girls were meant to be girls. I get it. And I‚Äôm beyond happy that they finally get to live life, what hurts me is that all of those years of them being in their natural born gender were lost and now they get to live life. No one and I mean NO ONE deserves that, time is such an ugly beautiful thing.

Size does not matter. As long as it makes you happy and it conforms with you  identifying  as a man. Which you are a full man. Glad you got your gender conformation. I am not a transgender  person  but am an advocate. And whether people wonder if you sit or stand to pee it does not matter. At the end of the day you are a man and personally as someone who has a boyfriend who misses the toilet more times than I can count I would rather teach him to sit to Pee. I have watched some of your YouTube videos and I just want to say that is your generation that will help the lbgqt community to be more open and to just be themselves which is what anyone wants whatever they identify as. As I always say love Is love. And again at the end of the day we have to be happy with herself and be happy with Who We are. As I have said I am an advocate for the lbgqt community but I cannot believe that we still have to fight 4 people's rights to be who they are.

You have been so informative and I just love your relationship with your fianc√©. I can only hope that my son finds the love you both have for each other. That‚Äôs just me being a worrying mother üòÇ. You appear to be a really thoughtful person and I thank you once more for what you have done for Trans people and worrying parents like me. You have made this so much easier for me. My son has top surgery in April and I know he will feel more confident once it is done. So excited for him! Much love for you both xx
UPDATE - He was so happy when he had top surgery but since September he has tried to commit suicide and now is on serious drugs that we are helping him get off hopefully for the 2nd time. He is hurting and feels that no one accepts him out side the house. It‚Äôs really hard but we will get him through this and all I can hope for is that he accepts himself. He knows he is loved but whether he feels it is another matter! üòû
Update - he has since been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism So is on medication. This has helped him a lot to understand himself. Now wonder he was stressed out. He now has been clean for a while and although still gets depressed he is not so hard on himself. Also being on Testosterone changes his hormones as well as his moods.

"I enjoyed your videos very much! Thank you for being open about those''technicalities'', even though it concerns something so personal about your own life-sexuality...you do it with simplicity, honesty, and a great sense of humour! you made me laugh out loud!! I  know someone who transited from being female to male, but that was some 25 years ago...it wasn't that much talked about, even less accepted...and from what i can see, huge progress has been made in that field of surgery. The person i knew was in my in-law family and i'm curious so i questionned, and he nicely answered my questions...that's why i say that progress was made...I want to tell you this person had a enormous amount of courage and determination because people were not always nice to him and that's a shame...once again, thank you, and may life be good to you!

"Honestly, it depends largely on the surgeon performing the procedure. I'm an RN, and ive seen some...horrendous work before. Working in the ER, i have also seen some nasty infections from people trying to save money by going to certain...discount medical care countries...which i wont name because the internet doesnt much tolerate negative things about these places...


I have also seen some incredible surgeries where i wasnt even aware that a transition surgery had taken place until being told.


As a rule, with any surgery...if they are offering to do it for a massive discount compared to other surgeons...buyer beware...


Also, congrats on a successful transition (so far) and keep your head up. Some of my favorite people have GD (including my little sister, but that whole situation is complicated, so she might become my brother at some point.

"I don't know why anyone would think 7-8 inches is an average sized penis. Five inches is average. There are some bigger and some smaller. Men tend to be proportionate. If he's pretty tall he'll usually be a little bigger. If he's under five feet tall he'll be a little smaller. Who the hell wants ten inches? That could cause damage. Not to mention most bigger guys don't know what the hell they're doing. They think size will do it. Wouldn't you rather have a guy who knew what to do, how to use it and cares if you're happy about it? Ignore the weirdos and do what makes you happy.

"I have seen so many comments here saying Trans isn't real or ""Accepting trans people won't make this a better world"" 

I am gender fluid and pansexual. And it drives me crazy when people post hate comments. What do I think of these comments exactly? I think that those are both opinions and because it is 2019 they're both wrong. Everyone is so focused on the LGBTQ+ Community that we don't see the real problems. Sure, spend your time putting hate comments on social media and protest our rights, you do you. But I'm just saying that what they do with their life doesn't have any effect on yours. It is a choice to let their beliefs and choices interfere with your time and life. You won't agree with everything in your generation. My opinion on the matter? Live and let live. For all of you Christians discriminating us, just stop. God is the only one that is allowed to judge us.

"There are things i don't understand with gender dysphoria and the transpeople. 
Why do transmen, all around the world, transition into what the west think a 20th or 21st century male is like? There are many cultures around the world where males wear what would be considered women's clothing by the west. Even ancient greek and roman men would wear what normally a woman would wear today. I've tried to search for a transmen with long hair on youtube but couldn't find one. They all have short hair. Men do grow their hair. Men have always had long hair. So why do all transmen have short hair and facial hair (a small amount don't have facial hair), at least on youtube? It's like they are trying to become a caricatural male. No variation whatsoever. 
Even with choosing names. What if names, from the beginning of time, were neutral. A name won't make someone become more male or female. A feminine gay man with a male name will still be gay and feminine.
Now transpeople have gender dysphoria and once they transition, the GD goes away (i get this from a trans who commented on another video). How does the GD go away? Your body will always be what it was at birth, even with cosmetic surgeries. Not even CRISPR can do something about that (could be wrong). So how does transitioning help? From my point of view, it's like playing pretend. Cause for a transmen, for eg, just having short hair is the same as going through a wardrobe change, taking hormones, having surgeries. The birth body will remain the birth body. Same applies for transwomen. Normally the GD shouldn't not go away. And if it does, transpeople might as well have tried living as biological males or females and follow a therapy for the GD.
Most trans people are born in a healthy and normal body. Yet it's the body that has to change, through a painful process, to fit what's in the mind. It seems really extreme. What if tomorrow, someone came up with a pill to totally cure gender dysphoria? No more feeling being in the wrong body. Would trans people take it? Wouldn't that be the reasonable choice?
I'm trying to UNDERSTAND, NOT ATTACK AND HURT, the trans community. So if you reply to my comment, please be civil.",UgwM6-gd8LtDehx3E3h4AaABAg,4,0,2019-09-19T03:36:33Z,1

"To the first question... for starters there's different pros and cons to both, but also is that person trolling here? even surveys have come up with the fact the average is probably closer to 5 inches.. Lol I can't Imagine meta has it like a whole ton smaller than that like maybe a few inches but still XD 7-8 minnimum? And 10 is like the average to this person? Good goppletygook have they met some well-hung individuals/ are really bragging then lol. Cause 7-8 is like the higher end of average I thought could just be wrong but like damn hun no... that's that's like way overshooting that.

"The person who thinks 10 inches is possible with phallo is seriously misinformed and clueless about male biology. The average biological penis is like 5.8 inches or maybe even 5.6.
Having 8 inches is incredibly unlikely, and the phallus cannot shrink and get erect (without an implanted device), it is constantly the same size. You would need a permanently stiff rod in it, so constantly having 7 stiff inches either angled up, or down just wouldn't be practical. It would likely result in the rod splitting through the flesh or corroding the flesh around it. Or, the other option is the pump device, which has loads of flaws as well. That doesn't remove the 7 inches of flesh that you constantly have to flop around so it is in a comfortable position.

Erectile implants have to be replaced, and it has a high risk of infection, to the point that the entire phallus needs to be amputated.
Phalloplasty horror stories are worth looking into before you consider getting it. It most likely, is not worth it.",UgzSnuGmHW556_3zRO14AaABAg,0,22,2019-09-18T18:43:54Z,1

"Ive been questioning my gender for some months now. The past weeks I have found that my dysphoria has gotten worse the more I start accepting?/questioning if I'm trans. Like, I'll get really happy and euphoric when imagining myself as a boy and then I'll get really sad and stuff when I ask myself ""what if I'm actually cis, what if I'm a g i r l?"". I have other mental issues so its even harder and Im just really confused but also I kind of want to accept that Im trans, and am a boy but then I start doubting myself and start crying because I get so anxious. What if I'm pretending? Is it too early to know? God, I am so confused. I tell myself that I should wait until I feel better mentally (I'm in a very depressive episode, have been for the past weeks) and then I can see if I'm actually trans or if I have been mistaken. Gaaah I just really dont wanna be wrong about this, I have social anxiety so I super wanna be sure of myself before I come out to my school or my family. I have told my closest friend that I think I'm trans and I have given them my new name and that feels so great! But I'm still in a lot of pain the more I long for getting to transition and the more I watch others live happily as who they are. Gah this is frustrating.

"I'm not sure if I'm trans or not but I'm always feeling more like a guy and I just never really feel like a girl but I do wear boys clothes and act more masculine and I feel so much better as my male side of who I have named ""Levi"" who uses male pronouns and is a guy overall but my female side (my biological sex) ""Chloe"" who is a girl and  is supposed to love more feminine things. (Sorry if that last part sounds weird but I didn't know how else to put it). I have semi long hair but it's super thick and I absolutely hate it cause it's super hard to manage. It's the main reason I have dysphoria but my parents say ""no you'll look like a boy"" I can't tell them because I'm not completely sure myself yet and I'm still so many years away from even being able to seem to have an opinion about my hair around my parents. If I were to cut it I feel as if my parents (mainly my dad) would freak out and my dad would probably break something in the house and most likely hit me. He's slapped me across the face 4 times on Christmas leaving bleeding cuts in my mouth from my braces from not washing my hands after touching a ball that had glitter on it. I feel like they really wouldn't support me if I were to be trans anyway I can't tell my dad anything in fear I might end up in the hospital and him end up in jail. I've been asking for just a pixie cut that goes up to my nose for 3 years and now he only makes fun of me and gets hostile over the fact of me asking for a normal haircut. I've actually started cutting and crying myself to sleep some nights because of how much my dysphoria has effected me along with all my other disorders that I can't get help for because they will only make fun of me for having.

"I had GCS in Thailand in 2014 and I love the result!  But the trip was excruciating.  Short version;  I went by myself, my girlfriend dumped me by text the day before my surgery, the nurses at the hospital WITHHELD MY MORPHINE, I started having hallucinations when they sent me back to my hotel, the person responsible for getting me to the airport at 2am for my flight home to California FORGOT me and could not be reached,  I had to jog through the HUGE Bangkok airport to just barely make my plane, I was prescribed NO painkillers for the 18 hour trip home, I got thrown out of the restroom in Japan during a layover because I am trans, and I had 3 gross and painful infections when I finally got back home.  Would I do it again?  YES!!!  I cried so hard when I came out of surgery that my doctor broke down as well.  It was the best day of my life.

"I'm curious what it was that made you think that you needed the bottom surgery. I've looked at the bit of statistics that i can find and there are tons of males that are attracted to mtf trans , but very , very few are interested in a mtf transgirl  that has had the surgery. I    know a fair amount of males who are very trans attracted , but all of them are totally turned off by the bottom surgery. So if any trans girl is getting the surgery to get guys it seems to be a counter productive surgery to get. On the other hand if it is just for their own personal mental needs to feel more female , i'm also curious how that makes one feel more female. And i mean this sincerely , can this be explained to me. To me one's genitalia is not the deal maker for being female. So i personally don't see the need to take such a huge risk and perhaps mutilating oneself. I'm glad you did this video and hope that you perhaps follow up by doing more on this subject and perhaps talk to other transgirl's to explore their thoughts on the matter and perhaps identify what drives someone to take such a drastic measure. But most of all is it really necessary and why is the such dysphoria over genitals which are something that should give pleasure and not mental anguish. This to me is one of the two main problems for transwomen. The other being how to make life easier for males who are trans attracted to admit their attraction. If it was easier for them then that would also solve huge issues for transwomen.",UgxWuqG4Atg3pg5JjqZ4AaABAg,0,0,2019-07-16T03:39:36Z,2

"re: 5:40. Everyone has their own ""scent."" Proper hygiene and paying attention to what's going on down there no matter who you are and what gender is essential. Vaginas aren't normally overwhelming when it comes to smell, and if something smells ""off"", it probably is. Scents change according to diet, activity, and many other things. Perpetuating the shame about how women smell or how vaginas look isn't a great angle. But yeah, nice wig or whatever.",Ugzsi1YarS4z3h5hlCB4AaABAg,8,165,2019-04-19T04:38:18Z,2

I will let you in to a secret. GRS was hard to get done yrs ago when i did mine over 3 decades ago there was a much stricter criteria. Lots of us who did GRS many decades ago. Did so then some of stayed around a few yrs to help other following behind us the same as other had before us, Then disappeared in to the woodwork and got on with our lives as woman.   Nowadays lots live to be trans and never move on. You will never get a true rate of success and regret because lots go unseen.  They fixed their problem and moved on. Which was the whole point in the surgery.  I recently had a 3hr conversation with police officers at my home. The 1st thing i told them is you do not have to feel like your stepping on eggshells around me.   I'm not part of the new wave trans movement. Who will go apeshit if a wrong word or phrase is used.  I think that's why we chatted so long as they had lots of question. They did ask me if i would come talk to the police force and educate them on a side of being Transexul they had not encounted before.  I explained i would rather not and gave my reason why.  I personally feel there will be more regretting surgery now than those from decades ago.",UgyaB299jw4Pn2cuxHJ4AaABAg,0,2,2019-04-12T23:04:21Z,2

"Great video Gigiüòä Very informative with a realistic message. That's what I love about you. You've found your happiness & that's all that counts. You're no more or less of a woman with or without the bottom surgery. You still deserve the same level of love, support, kindness, & basic respect reguardless. I'm a mtf (age 22) 6 months into HRT, laser hair removal & cosmetic aspects. Not sure if I'll get full gender/sex reassignment surgery or not? Might do part 1 then wait years for part 2. Looking into it though. I'm torn it's 50/50. Deep down yes, it is something I want. But I have a bit of fear of the risks/pain. It is a scary intense surgery. It would just be for me & nobody else. Sometimes I'm like why fix something that's not broken? Plus it costs the most money. It's the only part of transitioning that's expensive. But some health insurances do cover it more & more. I'm for sure getting a bilateral orchiectomy though. Most Drs recommend it due to being on t blockers too long causes blood clots & organ failure. So once testosterone is premanently gone you can lower estrogen & go off blockers. Less risks!  It's been a long courageous battle for me but I'm on the transition path. Thanks to love & support from my wonderful family & amazing medical care. We all only live one life. It's important to be happy, healthy & comfortable in our own bodies.
The truth is there is no right or wrong way to transition. Society places labels & expectations on trans people. 
Best of luck to you Gigi no matter what you decide we all care & support you‚ù§Ô∏è",UgzOvw2MuCmmt1c0Gp14AaABAg,0,0,2019-03-17T15:36:52Z,2

"Although I THOUGHT you had gone thru the surgery YEARS ago, I'm glad to find out you didn't but above all are honest and vocal about it because I can't tell you how many times I heard ""I'll never be perfect like Gigi, I can't get the surgeries done etc etc etc"" so I KNOW for a fact this video will reassure a LOT of trans women, that they can be as gorgeous as you without the damn surgery...as YOU YOURSELF don't even have it contrary to popular belief. I'm sure if you did a poll (don't lol) people would say they thought you had gender reassignment years ago. It's crazy. It's almost like a Mandela effect because a lot of folk even remember you saying it, which again is crazy cuz you obviously have not said it. So THANK YOU for being so open and candid (which you do NOT have to be)...I'm sure this will help a lot of women, trans and otherwise, who think of themselves less because of not having done or having been able to do whatever surgery, in this case reassignment surgery.

"Oh girl, this really hit me HARD. I'm not trans, but I often completely share this feeling of being indecisive, unsure, or feeling like a particular situation is not completely fulfilling that 'dream moment' that I imagined it or want it to be. It gives me massive anxiety, and the whole thing gets me down as I feel like other people don't get these thoughts and just live their life normally without overthinking! Hearing you speak like this about these kind of decisions, coming from you, such a content, confident woman, really is affirming to me that this way of thinking is a very human quality, and not something to feel ashamed of!

"You're gorgeous regardless, but this hair color is sooooo you. It gives you a very soft and elegant appearance. A friend of mine had gender reassignment surgery about 4 years ago and she is loving it. I watched her go through so much research, therapy, consultations, and years of saving up money to see her dream of becoming her true self. Just going through the beginning stages, hormone therapy, implants, some minor facial reconstruction to give her face a more feminine appearance, her personality and attitude shined even brighter. I also loved the fact that she has so much support from her family friends. We also worked together, and a huge to do was made when she came back to work (after taking a mental health leave to get a handle on what she would be dealing with) meetings were held in each department with our supervisors explaining what transgender meant, that she would start using the woman's bathroom, etc etc. For the most part everyone was like ok why are we even having these meetings and making a big deal about her, then there were a few ignorant people that made their comments and I made sure to try to educate them. I even asked her to come up to my department to introduce herself, and she was very open to answering anyone's curiosity questions.

"Hi Gigi, it good that you not do it when you not feel ready as this will change forever. I am from Thailand and work in plastic and medical in Thailand. I don't know which Dr, you went to... As thailand for surgery that will be under GA you should have it done in hospital not at clinic if you are went to clinic, some surgeon will have their consultation at the clinic and have surgery in private hospital and the service quite good. :) 
Also most surgeon who work with foreign client many of them have very good English. You don't even have to call them, all you need is sending them email, but for SRS it is required face to face consultation.. also first thing before the procedure start on discussion, our partner surgeon always ask for the letter from your psychologist. I work with many surgeon in Thailand.. And if you have surgeon done in The place like Bumrungrad or BDMS hospital group there is nothing to complain. There is few specialist in Bangkok who perform in hospital and also in Phuket.  
In Thailand if you do surgery under GA it will required a night stay in hospital, except you went to dodgy clinic.... and I dont recommend to do that.  Also here if you do surgery in hospital you will be ask to pay for your surgery before you going to surgery, full amount there is no down payment. :)

"IF YOU EVER CONSIDER GETTING GRS AGAIN, I'D ADVICE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE PPV (peritoneum pull through vaginoplasty) TECHNIQUE recently developed in Mumbai. After use on cis women they've altered it to fit the needs of trans women. This technique completely eliminates issues such as lack of depth, self lubrication and life long dilation. Peritoneum tissue is sensitive to hormonal influences, during the healing process it stabilizes the vaginal cavity and changes its characteristics to those of biological vaginal mucosa. Hopefully this technique will become the world wide standard! BTW that hair colour looks GORGEOUS.",UgxsMHjSMdAbcPJ5KtJ4AaABAg,1,7,2019-03-05T22:22:00Z,2

"Hi GG , I can`t tell you how glad I am you got out , while the getting was good !! You don`t seem to be lacking smarts , but FYI : It is common for a MtF gender change operation after care to last in hospital for 7 to 10 days. At home care and time to heal up to  two months. 
You need to heal , I don`t want to trigger you with unnecessary specifics , but just Google and you soon understand.¬†
I hope you get your dream , I truly do , and UCLA from what I hear has an excellent transgender center , so I must ask , why go anywhere else if you already live in California ???

"I'm happy that you didn't go through with it when you weren't comfortable and I think it was the right decision for sure. However, with serious subjects like this, I always wish you would stray from the click bait or misleading title. Because this isn't your SRS story. You even said it at the end. You don't know what that is going to look like for you. But misleading titles like this make people expect to learn about something and then to have you say just kidding I didn't do it. It's an informative storytime I just wish it wasn't a misleading title. I hope you take your time and go through with it if and when you are ready and have all your support system there with you.

If you identify as any of those things and don‚Äôt meet that mold it‚Äôs perfectly ok. But the term Pan gave me a freedom and joy I never knew I had.

DONT get me wrong. I think this is beautiful and finding yourself. But. It‚Äôs sad that we still need to label everything in a ‚Äòcoming out‚Äô video. I think that society is sooo caught up on labeling it. Your not trans. Your not gay. Your just YOU. I think you love who you love and you are who you choose to represent yourself as and that‚Äôs amazing. But I hate the whole labelling it something. I would love to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion. I just think it sucks that people still feel like they need to belong to a sub category instead of it just being ok to live your life as how u want to.,Ugz6dxgMTsHMY4I2otV4AaABAg,0,2,2021-04-12T01:09:30Z,2

Hi gigi! Im so proud of you for this coming out! Im 21 and came out to my family as bi (but mostly pan cause my family doesnt use pansexual in french its not as used).

So pretty much if we‚Äôre looking at it technically in a religious strict kind of narrow minded point of you. You were born male so you were attracted to men that made you gay now you identify as female but in some peoples eyes you‚Äôre still male dating a female so that would make you straight? Or bisexual or pansexual who knows but nevertheless I look at you as a female I feel that I‚Äôm going to respect that and identify you as what you identify as. Because to me that‚Äôs a respect thing and I see you as a female. Because if I look at you as a male it just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me it doesn‚Äôt feel right to me. And other people I don‚Äôt know I can‚Äôt speak for them but at the end of the day it is your life.. xo,Ugz_4UC9KWioU1_FUNl4AaABAg,0,0,2021-04-11T20:52:29Z,2
We really don‚Äôt care what you do in your bed at night or What or who you identifiers. At the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt pay my bills I can care less as long as you stick in reality and just know that everybody is treated equally when we cross over as long as you know that I don‚Äôt care what you do with your personal life because that‚Äôs your personal life you know what I‚Äôm saying we live in at a time in era where everybody‚Äôs excepted give or take you know some small towns but just don‚Äôt go to the small town so you know I‚Äôm saying.

"I identify as Bi but I know that technically that I would be more pansexual. I am attracted to people regardless of gender. But I grew up in a small town and didn't know about pansexual (until I moved away) so I identified with Bi because it was the closest thing. It's easier for me because I dont have to explain bisexuality to small town people who have limited knowledge on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.

"i honestly think pansexuality is the highest form of love. loving someone for them. when i met my partner we were both straight, then as friends we came out as bi to one another. later on we started dating and half a year through i came out as pansexual and later that week she did also. My partner now identifys as nonbinary so They/them and her educating me on her feelings opened me up and made me realise i feel the same way. When u mention your partners soul, thats how my partner and i think. she could be in any body and i would love her and same goes for me. thats why over these year it doesnt matter what we want to label ourselves or how we want to present ourselves we love the person beneath all of that.

IDK how to explain it but when I hear 'pansexual' or I say to myself 'I am pansexual' I just don't feel anything. But I also feel like bisexual doesn't fully encompass who I am either. I'm going into my early 20's so I'm still young and not too worried about it but it is confusing and still something I struggle with so this is comforting to see someone who embraces sexuality and identity as a journey.",UgweIU-9pznhGYKLISl4AaABAg,1,2,2021-04-09T22:10:16Z,2

it can be so hard to make decisions based solely off what you think is going to make yourself happy without worrying about how your decision might look to other people, but in the end i know i'm going to feel so much better knowing that i did something with the one goal of making myself happy and proud to be who i am.

Seeing so much overwhelming support for Gigi and so little hate for her coming out as Pan makes my heart happy.
It's nice to see so much acceptance, especially when I've been so discouraged. It let's me know there's a lot less hatred towards it than I had thought.
Pansexual is the one label that's felt Right for me to have, and I'm still coming to terms with it but overall I'm happy to finally have something I can identify as and be like yeah, that 100% fits.

It is so fascinating how our body works and how technology is so advanced that people are able to get biologically for masculine or feminine! I genuinely found it so interesting.

"1. Your body did not ‚Äústop producing testosterone entirely‚Äù (like 0 nm of it), it just dropped to around as low a level as a female‚Äôs after you took blockers. The surgery doesn‚Äôt stop testosterone production in the body entirely, either. 
2. You weren‚Äôt getting PMS, since you cannot and will never be able to menstruate. That‚Äôs just flat out misinformation. The change in your emotional sensitivity changed because of the Estrogen (which makes humans more emotional in general since it affects theneurotransmitter systems in hormone such as serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in your brain). The symptoms may be similar to what you saw in manstruating women, but it‚Äôs NOT the same.",Ugxd9Kxbk5i9g3mnW_Z4AaABAg,1,0,2022-04-25T13:42:22Z,2

"Dear Mathilda , I always love watching your videos. I'm a trans woman myself , 26 years old , have been on a regular dose of hormones from 19 to 21 and then I was forced by my family to switch to a low dose of HRT. I have been on low dose of HRT ever since. I'm 26 now , regularly get male fail , grew my hair out and was forced by my family to put social transition off. Now it has taken its toll on my mental health. I have a good job , I just finished a Ph.D. but I am not where I want to be. I realised a couple years ago that I need to go all the way to be happy with myself , just like you. You are one of the few trans women Youtubers I can relate to because I'm a straight trans woman myself , just like you. I am an outlier because most of us who knew as children are already fully transitioned for a long time at my age , so I am sad for all these years that I lost but better late than never. I hold hope because I have seen lots of successful transitions from women who transitioned after age 20 and I have good ingredients to work with : I'm 5 feet 5""6 and have a naturally feminine voice already. Just like you I want breast augmentation and SRS. I am most scared of dating post op. I am scared how a straight cis man will react when we hit it off and I will have to tell him that I had a male gender marker on my passport ID until the latter half of my 20s. I relate so much to you because we are around the same age and just like you I am a very chatty person who can go on and on for hours talking :D 
I also am very open about myself .
I love how society is becoming so much more tolerant towards girls like us as of lately.
I still have a long road to go but channels like yours give me hope for my future.

Who knew that one day people would actually adopt the procedure that came from a pedophile Dr. Who did experiments on children . Especially since it turned out to be such a disaster. He was born and the Dr. Botched his circumcision and the Dr told his parents it's nurture not nature and he had a twin brother so making him a girl would be a perfect test . Well he ended up making them sleep together and he recorded it . The boy found out about what happened to him around age 14 and said he always knew he was a boy and change his name back to the original and started over as a true boy . Years later he killed himself and a while after that his twin killed himself too. The Dr also did other sick and twisted stuff on kids but it has nothing to do with transgender so I guess nature has something to do with it and a lot of people are now detrasisioning so if you want to be another gender be sure you really want it  and I would try everything else possible before you permanently mess around with your body.,UgxHbTAO3xQnONghLrt4AaABAg,0,0,2021-11-06T14:41:11Z,2

"I fear that while trying to portray your experience as transparent you neglect to inform the viewer on the full risks of what you're doing to yourself and your body. You're not telling the full story, and portraying it from the perspective of almost pseudo encouragement by saying it was the answer to your dismorphia. This video could easily mislead and harm children and naive adults, please reconsider your approach. Your complaints are about your innate masculine features and by complaining about what the therapy did in a damaging way, it insinuates how that damage helped correct your look to be more feminine. Not everyone will have the same feminizing effects taking hormone therapy, some men might just get male pattern baldness and more visceral fat, some men might end up losing the cartilage inbetween their bones. Just because you ended up getting fat in ""all the right places"" for your goals doesn't mean that will happen to all. To pretend that the side effects of your treatment happened as they should and that all hormone replacement and therapy will lead to desired results is a lie at best, and intentionally misleading at worst.

You're pretending that the few things you do complain about are the biggest risks, yet you refrain from sharing any other traumatic responses to hormone therapy like astigmatism, infertility, bone density degregation, increase in cancer risk, damaged immune system, hypo/hyper thyroidism and blood disease.

Like so many others in this community, your explanation of your therapy is completely focused on the visual and cosmetic, rather than the intrinsic and internal affects done to you. You're playing a game with your words, and while you may not intend it, these are the consequences. You are not a medical doctor, nor are you qualified to talk about your ""experience"" in an educational way. Your ""honesty"" is harmful.

"I am a Christian. A Man of Christ, and biblical doctrine.

Jesus once said that if it were not for a whore who helped a fleet of Christians escape the wrath of a tyrant who was killing all Christians or Jews that stowed these two men away, than there wouldnt be much of a Church today.

He basically meant that discrimination is not a thing in his life.

With that being said.

Personal preferences are a direct result of standards that are enforced and the way that they are enforced be it good (functional) standards... or bad (dysfunctional) standards have a great impact on how a person interprets themselves and everyone else around them.

Its not all that clear if what you have done to yourself is wrong....

However, I think that in a since now that you are infact a woman, there is nothing wrong with being a woman.

I think what you have done is forgivable, it does not seem there is anything against this so long as you take responsibility for yourself the way that you are now.

I still think that our points of views are often a result of how standards are imposed over us.

Like for example.

I had a very hard headed Christian family whom I dont think are very Christ like.

Their very deceitful hypocrites who are very proud and shallow who love their comfort more than God.

They themselves are unforgiving...

I was always small, weak, and silly.

As a boy, this made very narrow minded people view me as being too much like a girl.

Even I believe that I would have fit in better as a girl.

My personality was always hyper sun shine happy and sinsitive and weak...

But, I recognized myself as a boy...

It was the rest of the world that beat in the idea that Im not man enough to be a man...

If that wasnt bad enough, I was molested as a small boy by an older boy.

I felt further and further feminised.

I dont feel what you feel exactly....

I feel like my body isnt man enough or beautiful enough for attracting woman.

I feel beside myself in my own skin.

And everyones Idea of the word Man is so steriotypical.

Im a Man, not a God.

I bleed, I bend, I break, Im not invencible...

Sometimes, because of all the pressure...

I just wish I was a woman just for a little while....

So I can be loved or ignored and people would expect less of me...

Id rather be the supporting nurturing character not the lead honcho who carries the whole world on his shoulders....

Everything is so heavy to be a man....

And Im so small....

And Im just that piece that just doesnt fit in all the gooves just right...

I think your pretty and if thats the direction you want to go in, I wont judge...

You look extremely attractive and your true to yourself.

Its not like your Gay.

Your a straight woman...

You have all the right parts and your body is clearly a womans body....

I accept you the way you are.

There is no reversing it so you may as well just own it.... Its who you are...

I dont think Jesus hates you...

I think he feels youve corrected it one way or another...

After all... he said if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out...

Clearly your body was causing you to sin...

So, you plucked it out...

You made a correction.

Your lovable, and sweet.

I like you.",UgzTzkpfMgKzCMTp3P14AaABAg,1,1,2021-09-25T16:39:34Z,2

"As an older women who would like to have a small amount of hormone replacement to feel better but am warned about all the potential dangerous side effects of doing so, I find it strange that doctors are  giving trans people massive doses of the opposite gender's hormone.  I know that too much testosterone can cause cardiac issues and sudden heart attacks.  They warn me about blood clots and strokes with estrogen and progesterone.   While I fully support a person's right to choose which gender they identify with, striving to be 100% male or female using hormone replacement is dangerous.   I also wonder why the medical community denies millions of women hormone replacement while young men can get massive doses of estrogen and progesterone.  The Women's Health Initiative of 1985 saved the insurance business millions or billions of dollars by declaring hormone therapy for women was dangerous.  Here we are 35 years later, this debunked, yet doctors still cling to antiquated research results.",UgxQtkjYQxH1J4qcI3p4AaABAg,2,0,2021-08-28T13:33:00Z,2

Tablets go under the tounge and are absorbed sublingually. I take 4 2 mg tablets of estridal under the tounge everyday. You absorbe the most Estrogen this way and its the safest method.

"does being on hormones for the rest of our life, reassessing your cosmetic features and changing how you dress really help with the feeling of being who you want to be? I guess what i'm asking, do you really have to do all these irreversible unnatural things to your body to really feel the transition? Could people have had sex changing procedures long ago or is this a new thing people just do now  because it's more readily available. This isn't a transphobe comment moreso i'm just concerned how far people will go with it you know?

Were you actually experiencing PMS because you have a hormonal/menstrual cycle due to hormone replacement, or do you just mean you were feeling emotional?

"So, I can't obviously speak for everyone, but the thing you say at 2:50 : Where I work most females are either as tall as me or taller (and I am 5ft 6.9"", which is the average height for females seen in 2018) and I have gone through boy puberty fully.
I've actually had some people (men and women, though it's ""funnier"" when women ask it when they are already outside if the average height range seen in most females) ask me if I would not like to be a little bit taller because ""well, I mean, you are not like, supertall"" (Dutch people are among the tallest in the world, so that might be one of the reasons for asking this).
And I have also had people who are confused, which, most of the time people tend to be just for someone being transgender, but because they don't get how I managed to stay short.
The point I'm trying to make: try to keep biological diversity in the back of your head when you think about this.
(This also goes out to people who like to place certain ""biological traits"" usually observed mostly in men under an insane magnifying glass when they meet someone who they know is a transfemale and like to emphasize all the things ""that make that you can tell she was born male"", because even if someone is slender while tall and born female and identifies with the sex assigned at birth, you will hear absolutely no one about someone's height in the way you can hear people discuss someone's height when being a transfemale).",UgzjYHW2nx-TCqwRthN4AaABAg,0,0,2020-12-05T20:48:12Z,2

Everyone has estrogen it's just biological females produce more than males but a trans person must also take something else to block the testosterone unless they get their balls removed.

"I do believe both male and female still need both hormones to maintain a stable balance and growth development. Female still need a small amount of testosterone for health and immunity, even brain development.

"You were still growing at 18... I stopped growing taller when I was like 14 :(. And I had like way more testosterone than most guys when I was growing up lol. Honestly though, a lot of stuff I used to attribute to testosterone, might actually have been early signs of Graves Disease: Like being able to lose weight really easily without exercising much, being exhausted all the time without really doing anything, hot flashes, feeling like I had a fever when I didn't(kinda like a longer hot flash lol), aches and pains, extreme anxiety, excessive and rapid hair growth, shaky hands(could also be from working out, but also a sign of hyperthyroid), sudden depression and other mood swings for no apparent reason...

Ive felt very little physical change in my musculature, a little on my chest, and none on my hips. So, everyone is different, yes, but because you were able to start when you were still IN puberty, you're IMMENSELY better off.

I hate myself everyday for not seeking help when I was younger, Because now i‚Äôm stuck with such severe gender dysphoria and anxiety that I just wanna jump out the window, And it has only been made worse after I came out because now i‚Äôm stuck between two worlds.

When the body doesn't produces hormones and you stop them, it may be like a menopause in the beginning.

HRT doesn't work for everyone in the same way.. I started HRT in my 20's back in the late 1990's and have had little to no physical effects from it.. However it did help me mentally cope with being trans just physically I got no response from it.. Over the years I have been to three different Endo's and they really don't know why.. They just remind me that everyone reacts differently to HRT.. At first I was on Premerin - Spirno then later Estradiol - Spirno - Progestrone.. Done pills.. patches.. injections.. Sometimes I think my body is just missing something that makes it responsive to HRT.. However as I said it has helped me a lot mentally which is why I have chosen to stay with it.,UgxD8X7SUYVaEVJDqRp4AaABAg,1,16,2020-06-06T11:04:08Z,2

"A few things about the voice: people going on testosterone (mostly female-to-male trans people) will experience significant changes to their voice. You can also have VFS, vocal feminization surgery. Essentially, they tighten up your vocal canal and this makes your voice resonate at a higher frequency. Your voice will be very raspy initially, and you won't know how you'll sound for quite a while, but after a few weeks you'll sound as if you never went through the male puberty at all.",UgwFcyTlVWPJupET8414AaABAg,3,0,2020-05-20T04:55:31Z,2

PMS i think is not the correct term since you obviously can nit menustrate .Hormones influence mood for sure.
It must be difficult and yet exciting since you obviously wanted to be female .

You can't go through PMS and menopause if never had a period in your life. What you are experienced is simply a change in hormone levels and temporary imbalance. There are a lot of different types of hormones and all of them can cause mood swings. PMS is premenstrual syndrome and there are A LOT of physical symptoms. The mood swings are just a drop in the ocean. Don't say that you had PMS because you didn't have it and it sounds like your making fun of those that really go through PMS EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

Only you can know what emotional changes resulted from your hormone changes but I thought it might interest someone to know did estrogen triggers the release of a hormone called prolactin it results in some breast growth is caused by some medications for psychiatric conditions and other things even in cis men in addition to causing lactation in pregnant women it causes the production of tears in the tear glands so the amount of tears available for a man to cry and thus the physical threshold required to trigger pure release is higher this is one of the reasons I assume it sometimes when people with strong doses of female hormones such as women who are pregnant will sometimes say things like I don't even know why I'm crying not to say that their emotions are in anyway invalid,UgwnCfmSchN0zs5MQ3J4AaABAg,0,0,2020-03-20T22:12:45Z,2

"I'm a newbie trans who's FtM. I came here mostly out of curiosity, and to educate myself, but now I can't stop thinking about how frustrating being trans is. I'm hourglass shaped, have very full perfectly shaped breasts, my voice literally has not changed whatsoever from childhood and is super soft and high pitched even by female standards- I have everything girls see as desirable and before I knew I was trans, no one understood how I could possibly have such intense body image issues especially since pre-puberty, I didn't give a single damn about how I looked. Now I just look at my perfectly healthy beautiful female body and wish it was given to someone it fit and could keep it exactly the way it is without feeling so horrible all the time. I almost feel bad for ruining it, especially since it's so futile I know I probably won't ever be comfortable in my own skin, because the one thing hormones don't help an 18 years old with is height and I'm stuck being 4'8"" my entire life.",UgxJSeZtPu89gmytPzx4AaABAg,6,13,2020-02-24T08:09:16Z,2

It's something I badly wish I could do as well, I want to transition also (mtf), but if you read my post in the other video, you'll know I believe it's a big challenge for me, maybe impossible, esp since I don't want to come out as trans to friends/family.

"I don't normally interact, i just silently double tap your beautiful compositions and colors. but this time the way you feel people think of you and the way i as a follower think of you are so entirely different that i need to speak up. You are one of the most beautiful women on my following list. But you also have a way with color, with photography, with editing... not just a beautiful face but a beautiful mind which creates magic wherever she goes. A mind which produces images that i save and seriously analyze to understand how they look so pleasant. A mind which inspires me. When i was listening to you in the above video, sweety i thought it makes sense in a way. What i mean is that your mind creates harmony and beauty in everything it touches. It makes sense because your appearance is created by that very same beautiful mind. This is why you are so beautiful. Your looks and your accomplishments are not a random jackpot. You are your own design. And you inspire thousands to imagine just like you do. You use your image, your creation on ig to open the door to the cosmos of your beautiful mind. Part of the world is ugly, the part that makes you cry.

"So I relate to what you were saying about being a woman and non binary. I don't like being referred to as a girl by other people despite being born a female but I don't necessarily feel I fit identifying as a male either. This is where I become confused because I don't think I'm quite gender fluid as I don't move between both genders, I'm either neutral and don't choose to identify as a specific gender or I fit the gender identify of woman in terms of how I look etc. Would this make me a non binary woman then?

"I learned I was Asexual at the age of 54, two years ago. Aromantic as well, but I felt still somewhat off... until I bit the bullet yesterday and began to look at label definitions. When I read about Non-Binary it struck home. I consider myself a woman who is non-binary though I definitely feel stuck in the middle. I am not attracted to heterosexual romance stories, or Lesbian or even Bisexual stories, or relationships, but I am very attracted to and can feel on a soul-level the male bonding scenarios of both Straight and Gay males. I write Bromance stories, as well as Gay Romance (minus the sex, something I finally understood when realizing I was an Asexual on my particular level.) I never felt truly feminine, or truly masculine. Though I do carry more feminine areas than masculine... at times. :D So, right now I'm still learning about Non-Binary areas and your video here absolutely helped me grasp more clarity on the subject.

You expect us to be open-minded to your side but by the same token you get upset if we don't identify you properly.

Riley is a genuinely awful and narcisstic person who takes every critique as a personal attack and refuses to even engage in dialogue as she has admitted in videos with Ashley for example (I think that's her name) Constantly acts as an apologist for violent terrorist groups such as antifa, labels misgendering as <""violence"" claims that people having a preference is ""transphobic"" and so on. Even when one of her biggest critiques came out and apologized she had the AUDACITY to make an absolute insane video ""how to apologize"" I have ZERO respect for riley dennis but I will call her HER cus im being kind. People does not hate Riley for what she is, rather for her absolutely insane beliefs. Im so sick of trans ppl considering every form of critique to be ""hate"" and take it a sa personal attack.

"You are so, so articulate. Thank you for the work you did in making this video and for making a person questioning their gender not feel out of place because I haven't necessarily seen someone with the same exact story as mine. I haven't really seriously thought about my gender before I guess... But suddenly I've started experiencing gender dysphoria at the age of 21 while never experiencing it before at any point in my life that I can remember, and now I'm looking back and like my favorite songs in middle school were Androgyny and Cherry Lips by Garbage, which both definitely deal with trans themes imo. I'm thinking maybe I just never seriously thought about my gender before until like a month ago so I never really thought it might not be best for me? Until I started thinking about how much better I'd feel in social situations being a woman... So I think I've always had the euphoria (when I was little I used to 'play ballet' in my room with piano music), I just never put two and two together that what I really enjoyed in doing those activities  was the idea of filling a (very stereotypical) social role of what I thought it meant to be a woman back then. As I grew up those activities were kind of stamped out of me by my family, relatives, and church, so I really honestly forgot I could experience those feelings because I was always perceived as being a man. I just always felt like there was something missing, I mean if I am a man (ugh I hate this process) then I'm gay, so I thought that that was what I was missing, but I still would just have these deep-seated angers at random points about having to engage with strangers and friends as a man in every social situation and it was getting tiresome. I shoved it down as far as I could and would hang out with pretty bro-ish people (even though I didn't act super broey myself), even during college tho I expanded my circles to more feminine-presenting people then and realized that I was missing out on a lot of fun just being able to be myself 100%.

Now two things are making me start to experience this childhood gender euphoria I almost forgot about... 1. is my hair. The more I've grown it out the more I feel... just... right. Like I never noticed there was something off but now that I'm experiencing it there is something definitely off. And 2. is trying makeup. Once I started putting it on (with some friends) I just felt like this intense happiness that I was doing something to present as more feminine. Since these things are happening that might be why I'm ""suddenly"" experiencing dysphoria?

And I'm not even sure still if I am a woman 100%",UgxCJfLVT_YuRGaQdkB4AaABAg,0,5,2019-10-31T05:46:17Z,3

"Not sure if I missed this point in the video, but if anyone could help, I would really appreciate it! My ex has publicly come out as trans, changed their name and identifies trans masculine(to my knowledge, we are not in contact so all this is from FB and common friends). But during our relationship, I called them my girlfriend. Now, when I talk about this relationship and my experience within it(in therapy, with friends who bring it up, relatives etc), I am not sure how refer to them. Obviously I use the correct pronouns(they/them) and real name(correcting friends who use their dead name) but this term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô still slips out as for during most of the relationship I viewed them as a woman and we were a ‚Äòlesbian couple‚Äô and therefore I am not sure how to replace it. I don‚Äôt want to say boyfriend because as someone who dates multiple genders it just doesn‚Äôt feel right(doesn‚Äôt honour my sexual fluidity and experiences) and terms like partner seem too serious for the nature of our relationship. Of course mostly I just use the term ex, but especially when I tend to talk about my own sexuality and experiences the term girlfriend is easiest to determine the nature of this specific relationship. To clear up, they did begin questioning and partly transitioning at the end of our relationship and then my ex still preferred me calling them by the term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô.

Not sure if that made any sense, but I appreciate any help as I want to learn how to be a better ally and, regardless of our differences, respect my ex and their gender.

"On names: I've seen a lot of the older trans people (like me) change to something either close to their name, or with the same initials, along those lines. For instance, I know I Maureen who is now Mor, a Brian Laurence who is Brenda Lauren. With me, Christopher changed to Christyanne allows me to still use Chris, a name that I'm used to, and I'm too old and crotchety to get used to a new one. I changed my middle name far away from its old one, though, and the second part of my first gets close to what I would have called myself if I'd changed younger: Anna.",Ugz7JV5sFzwTkzIDgZB4AaABAg,0,22,2019-08-19T00:49:48Z,3

"I think Contrapoints has talked in a few of her videos about being trans without experiencing body dysphoria. 

Which makes me really not understand the people who accuse her of being a trans medicalist- of course she knows what it‚Äôs like to be trans without dysphoria- she‚Äôs talked about it pretty extensively. She‚Äôs said that she transitioned because she knew she would be happier, because she wasn‚Äôt happy with her gender. And while there were some elements of dysphoria (she‚Äôs also talked about realising that if she didn‚Äôt transition, she‚Äôd have to grow old as a gender that didn‚Äôt fit, and that was extremely uncomfortable for her), she‚Äôs also said that she doesn‚Äôt have specific dysphoria relating to her body. 

I would recommend her videos as well, though it‚Äôs important to understand she often engages in dialectic argument through characters, neither of which necessarily reflect her view. And she often delves into the philosophy of things, which doesn‚Äôt always reflect the reality of many trans folk. It‚Äôs still an interesting way to get some more viewpoints though.",UgwFiN8QKYuRls1AAY94AaABAg,1,4,2019-08-18T21:11:02Z,3

Also the issue of dead-naming/pronouns is very important to trans people.

"Great video. For the person asking about how Trans people choose a new name for themselves. Since you using that for a fictional character, it would be a good idea to take what the character is as an individual and couple that with the different ways Riley has described to choose how that character chooses a new name, since gender is just one part of a miriad of things that makes up an individual.",UgxKK33nIF30H47Ct4F4AaABAg,1,15,2019-08-18T17:56:55Z,3
