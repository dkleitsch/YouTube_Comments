2,While I cannot relate to going through Dysphoria I give you 100% praise and respect in sharing your experience with others. Really admirable and awe-inspiring listening to your story. Keep up with the great videos and stay awesome. Many wishes of success and love going out to you!,UgxXxzPUjGwFpuCjmit4AaABAg,0,0,2022-02-10T21:31:07Z,none

4,"Funny...even before I seriously considered that I might be trans, I gravitated towards baseball shirts and other styles that emphasized my shoulders de-emphasized any curves. I didn't do it on purpose. They just made me feel better.",Ugx20hOsS1ArBLu4WZ94AaABAg,0,1,2022-01-24T05:05:57Z,none
5,"also to add to when you were talking about shaving, with females if you shave any hair on your face or anything that isn't supposed to be shaved then it grows back black or just darker after awhile. so if that's something that you want to do then you can keep shaving and eventually have darker hairs grow back in those spots where you shave and get facial hair",Ugxwzc_hiLAwck0AcoJ4AaABAg,0,0,2021-11-27T03:45:02Z,none

7,"Ive been questioning my gender for some months now. The past weeks I have found that my dysphoria has gotten worse the more I start accepting?/questioning if I'm trans. Like, I'll get really happy and euphoric when imagining myself as a boy and then I'll get really sad and stuff when I ask myself ""what if I'm actually cis, what if I'm a g i r l?"". I have other mental issues so its even harder and Im just really confused but also I kind of want to accept that Im trans, and am a boy but then I start doubting myself and start crying because I get so anxious. What if I'm pretending? Is it too early to know? God, I am so confused. I tell myself that I should wait until I feel better mentally (I'm in a very depressive episode, have been for the past weeks) and then I can see if I'm actually trans or if I have been mistaken. Gaaah I just really dont wanna be wrong about this, I have social anxiety so I super wanna be sure of myself before I come out to my school or my family. I have told my closest friend that I think I'm trans and I have given them my new name and that feels so great! But I'm still in a lot of pain the more I long for getting to transition and the more I watch others live happily as who they are. Gah this is frustrating.

16,"Thank you very much, this helps a bunch.
My family doesn't know i'm a ftm and it's a pain.
My dysphoria was blank when I wanted to be with a girl but it recently came back and I can't deal with it anymore.
Mother and father wont let my get boy-short hair because they don't want me to look like a male. 
I can't bind because y mom has a keen eye...and my voice is already deep to where I dont need to worry about it.
I've gotten to the point where i'm getting more and more depressed about this and I had to look for a answer.

26,".. I'm 11, so it's going to be 5 years before I'm allowed to go on T. I've battled on and off with depression due to the dysphoria. One thing that I've found is that I get really envious. Since all of my friends are boys, I get really jealous of them and the fact that they are growing like regular teenage boys. My main issue though, is my face shape and figure. I only have B cups, but binding hurts my chest. And yes before any of you ask it was the right size. KT Tape pulls my skin off when I remove it, and theresnothing I can do to alleviate the dysphoria from my face shape. Is there anyone in the comments section in a similar situation as me with any advice to offer a fellow struggling trans guy?",Ugg5crd397anbXgCoAEC,4,23,2017-07-01T19:53:46Z,none
27,"I'm not sure if I'm trans or not but I'm always feeling more like a guy and I just never really feel like a girl but I do wear boys clothes and act more masculine and I feel so much better as my male side of who I have named ""Levi"" who uses male pronouns and is a guy overall but my female side (my biological sex) ""Chloe"" who is a girl and  is supposed to love more feminine things. (Sorry if that last part sounds weird but I didn't know how else to put it). I have semi long hair but it's super thick and I absolutely hate it cause it's super hard to manage. It's the main reason I have dysphoria but my parents say ""no you'll look like a boy"" I can't tell them because I'm not completely sure myself yet and I'm still so many years away from even being able to seem to have an opinion about my hair around my parents. If I were to cut it I feel as if my parents (mainly my dad) would freak out and my dad would probably break something in the house and most likely hit me. He's slapped me across the face 4 times on Christmas leaving bleeding cuts in my mouth from my braces from not washing my hands after touching a ball that had glitter on it. I feel like they really wouldn't support me if I were to be trans anyway I can't tell my dad anything in fear I might end up in the hospital and him end up in jail. I've been asking for just a pixie cut that goes up to my nose for 3 years and now he only makes fun of me and gets hostile over the fact of me asking for a normal haircut. I've actually started cutting and crying myself to sleep some nights because of how much my dysphoria has effected me along with all my other disorders that I can't get help for because they will only make fun of me for having. I'm still really young and feel like ending my life almost every day I really need some help on how to convince my parents to let me get a pixie cut before everything gets so much worse.",UgiMmhJvP4BR-3gCoAEC,3,3,2017-06-02T03:00:52Z,none
28,"From the friend of a transgender person, is there anything i can do to make them more comfortable as they start their physical transition?
