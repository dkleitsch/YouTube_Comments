5,"I know it's not ""cool"" to comment on old videos, but I just wanted you to know that I am starting T next month!! My mom is fully supportive, but wants to know more about being trans in general, so I sent her this playlist. Also, thank you so much for having it all captioned because she's deaf. I appreciate these videos SO much and they helped me learn a lot about being trans and helped me come to the realization that transitioning is right for me.

6,Big/deep topic to speak on would be.... How to explain being tran/nonbinary in a better way to children. Being able to help them understand the difference between what you were assigned at birth and your gender. I have a 6 and 5 year old and my son absolutely thinks short hair is only for boys and long hair for girls. I want to help him understand better than. Poppa was a girl and now feels best as a boy.,Ugz1b1SAJZmsIa8uJFV4AaABAg,0,0,2021-12-15T00:11:56Z,none

I also have ALWAYS wanted the ( biological sex ) person that they have been to date. So, there is a LOT of grief that will need to be worked through.

15,"My child came out to me as trans about a month ago, and I agree, every situation is different. I grew up very much feeling that I had the lgbtq's back. As a teenager I boycotted a local movie theater because they wouldn't let us see an (unrated) comedy about lesbians because we were underage. I did my senior high school project on crossdressers. When one of my girls came out to me as bi (age 10), I celebrated her bravery in speaking about something difficult. When my older daughter came out as lesbian and later genderfluid, I was likewise relatively unfazed. However, when that same genderfluid daughter eventually came out to us as trans, suddenly I found myself confused and a bit ashamed of my own reaction. As well as one of acceptance and unconditional love, it was also one of loss and conflicting emotions. I never would have thought pronouns would make a big deal, but for some reason they're a mental hurdle that's been difficult to get used to. Also, I spent a long time and a lot of love picking out an original and feminine name, and now he goes by the commonest male name I can think of. Probably the hardest thing has been trying to understand the identity of someone who grew up female and identifies as male. It  threw me into a state of reexamination of what parts of his personality were really his and which parts were based on my perception of him. As an ally to the community, I felt like a failure for not being able to understand or identify. One of my friends gave me sh*t about my mixed reactions too which hurt me. It's different when it's a child you've borne than when you're speaking about a community at large. My family is super supportive too, which is great, but to a degree I want to fight to defend his honor -- but there's no one among my family to fight. It's another part of why it's been hard -- trying to fight an imaginary enemy. I know he's run into some hard times with his peers, and that's not good, and I get that, but nothing within the family. I asked him to talk with me the other day about being trans, and he rolled his eyes and said, ""yeah, Mom, I know what you're going to say, that you love me and support me no matter what."" I said, ""yes, but you have to understand it's hard for me, harder than I  thought, and I hope you'll forgive me if I hurt your feelings or don't understand. I will do my best, and of course I do love and support you, but I'm having a harder time dealing with it than I thought I would."" To both my ex-husband and me, he has said that he'll go back to being our little girl if we want him to, which honestly has made the situation even more difficult. So I'm learning everything I can.",Ugy0dPkl7XAGnykMHyh4AaABAg,0,0,2021-08-17T03:16:42Z,none

17,"Is gender dysphoria an at all similar feeling to body dysmorphia? I know it's not the same but I have a long history of anorexia but have gained weight in order to pursue my dream to become a doctor but I feel like my body is too big, there are bits of my body that I wish didn't exist and I wish like I could cut them off. Also when people say I'm not fat I can't believe them because my anorexia knows that I am. Obviously this is different because my logical, medical student brain knows that I am not overweight but for trans people, they are absolutely correct in their beliefs about their gender, but I was just wondering if any of these feelings might be somewhat similar",UgwA2WiUXpRk2nA3lux4AaABAg,2,1,2021-08-03T13:33:58Z,none

If you're unhappy with who you are, getting a dick sewed on will not change that. Just because you take testosterone and say ""bro"" doesn't mean you're a dude. Being a guy is a lot more than tv characteristics and looks. Its one thing to relate to a characteristic of a male character you see on a tv show, but to reduce men to what you see on TV or in Mens magazines as the flawed ""definition"" of a man is shallow and to try and convince yourself that 'hey yeah, i can do that or act that way' will make you no more of a man that you already are.",UgzcDVkpzbGFGamfja14AaABAg,2,1,2021-05-18T14:07:50Z,none

Im a CIS male; he, his, him.. i like being male, but just cuz im male doesnt mean i HAVE to like what a MALE has to like, such as; sports, color blue, etc, but i do enjoy sports, art, and a variety of things. Everyone is different i get that, i just didnt have such an open mind as i thought i did, cuz this is complicated, stuff i didnt even think about. Anyways.. i guess im kinda questioning myself now... and idk why, cuz i do like being MALE. When i was younger, i have this very early memory that when i ran, i ran like a ""girl"" i thought. And i liked to pretend i had long hair, and when i played with dolls i always chose the FEMALE version dolls. People noticed this and made me feel very insecure. As i grew up i tried to change that cuz of what they said about me. But i do like being a MALE, so im way confused haha. I'll have to keep searching for knowledge, but i know itll be a while to do so, cuz im lazy to even click buttons, or mind tireness.

(I know someone and speaking of our childhood memories I'm never really sure if I should say him or her, since at that time he was in a girls body.) Also is the fact that you used to be in a different body 'important' to you, since you spend a huge part of your life in it

Even when I was a kid I would say I barely counted as a woman, or that I was a failure of a girl because I wasn't feminine much at all. And though I have long hair,  to me it seems more masculine, like a metal heads long hair rather than a girls long hair. I don't like looking at my face and I'm most comfortable with people using thr male nickname for my name.

217,"As a cis, the best way that one of my friend (who is trans) explained it to me was: Imagine that you woke up the next morning with ""male genitals"" (if you're a cis woman) or ""female genitals"" (if you're a cis man). You look in the mirror and the body that you see doesn't match who you are. Now imagine that you went to the store and the cashier said, ""thank you ma'am"" or ""thank you sir"" and you knew they were wrong but nobody else saw you the way that you felt. And you had to navigate through life with people assuming you were something that you weren't. Essentially, if you woke up looking like a female then you wouldn't suddenly identify as a woman; you'd still be the same person. Now I've educated myself more on the subject and know that there's a lot more to it then that and that I will never completely understand but it was a breakthrough for me when it came to beginning to understand more.",UgxK4n8EEBHrAkeSUpJ4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-02T02:27:30Z,none

That as a cis person we cannot actually 100% understand how someone that's trans feels, but we can try and mentally grasp the concepts that they are trying to share with us, and believe that what they tell us about how they feel is true. It's amazing how people won't even educate themselves on the basics so that they can make informed decisions when it comes to things like voting, healthcare, etc for people. Discounting your experiences in your life because they don't want to try understand where you're coming from, is wrong. Flat out. I'm so excited for the rest of this series and the 201 one as well.

253,"Some criticism: I agree with your general ideas but there are a few scenes I disagree with, or rather, would have worded differently. For example, the use of ""feel"", ""identify"", ""percieve"", ""gender identity"" and ""gender"". It's best not to use the words identify and feel because we don't identify or feel a gender. The only way you can feel male or female is the roles assigned, however we can generally ""feel"" that our sex is wrong, which is actually just dysphoria. I think it's best to not use the words gender or gender identity either  because they both refer to the social and cultural roles assigned to men and women, gender identity being which role you identify with the most and how you express that. As trans people, we know that this is not the case for us but we have been lead to believe that gender and gender identity is when our outside doesn't match the inside. However this description is inaccurate as gender has never referred to this, it's always referred to the social aspect. It would be much better to state that our sex does not match with who we are inside, hence dysphoria rather than our ""gender"". As you stated, this has nothing to do with gender non-conformity and by using the term gender, it just reinforces the idea that if you do not conform to your gender role, you are trans.",Ugx0RP4f7wMslAYBNwt4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-01T22:27:10Z,none

359,"I really like the sweater analogy when it comes to explaining how you know you're trans. It goes as follows: you're shopping with someone (this person represents society). You're in the changing room with them, and they're forcing a sweater on you, but it's way too small, and way too thin. You've been eyeing another sweater the whole trip, and it looks wonderful, but Society is telling you that you can't have that one. You decide to try it on anyway, and it's comfy and warm and fits just right. Society is telling you over and over that it looks ugly and isn't right and it's too expensive and you might change your mind, but you buy it anyway, and it's absolutely perfect.

That's what being trans is like. You have this unexplainable knowledge that the jumper you were given just does not fit, and society is telling you all these lies about what you should and shouldn't do, but there's nothing you want more than that sweater and you just KNOW you have to have it. You can't hide it away or pretend it doesn't exist. It's an inescapable part of who you are.",Ugjh9pAGZDq-33gCoAEC,3,164,2017-08-01T23:56:09Z,none

I just want to leave maybe a more nuanced comment about what you said about ""it's when your outside doesn't match your inside"" : as a trans person, i believe that my outside matches my inside, because I'm non binary and my body isn't inherently gendered (since gender is a social construct). It's society that associate my appearance with being a woman, but my body is not inherently ""a woman's body""; it's just a body. And this association body <=> woman makes me feel bad and feel dysphoria. That's just my experience, and not every trans person feel this way, but I wanted to highlight this as the narrative of ""born in the wrong body"" is in my opinion a simplistic and reductive description of being trans and I wouldn't recommend to use it even in trans 101 as it perpetuates cissexist ideas about bodies (I'm not saying that Chase said ""born in the wrong body"" I'm just giving more details because ""your inside doesn't match your outside"" could easily make people think ""oh they're born in the wrong body then"").",Ugg6lrvuTRDGIngCoAEC,9,10,2017-08-01T12:23:09Z,none
