"I know it's not ""cool"" to comment on old videos, but I just wanted you to know that I am starting T next month!! My mom is fully supportive, but wants to know more about being trans in general, so I sent her this playlist. Also, thank you so much for having it all captioned because she's deaf. I appreciate these videos SO much and they helped me learn a lot about being trans and helped me come to the realization that transitioning is right for me.

Big/deep topic to speak on would be.... How to explain being tran/nonbinary in a better way to children. Being able to help them understand the difference between what you were assigned at birth and your gender. I have a 6 and 5 year old and my son absolutely thinks short hair is only for boys and long hair for girls. I want to help him understand better than. Poppa was a girl and now feels best as a boy.,Ugz1b1SAJZmsIa8uJFV4AaABAg,0,0,2021-12-15T00:11:56Z,1

"Thank you for this. As a mother of of 32 yo. Newly coming out person, I am trying to learn everything that I can. I am TERRIFIED for my adult child. I also have ALWAYS wanted the ( biological sex ) person that they have been to date. So, there is a LOT of grief that will need to be worked through. ( The greatest being that they have suffered 32 years w/o feeling the freedom to share.) So, not all of us are Haters. We are just stunned, reeling, attempting to be supportive and grappling with or own mental health at the same time.

My parents have come a long way but it is still difficult to bridge the gap of their generation and traditions with us American born kids. We have someone who is transitioning right now and I would really like my family to gain more empathy so they don't alienate him. I am sending them this video so they aren't bombarding him with questions or making judgements without being educated first. This is such a clear, concise video so I'm hoping this video will get the message across even though their English isn't perfect.

"My child came out to me as trans about a month ago, and I agree, every situation is different. I grew up very much feeling that I had the lgbtq's back. As a teenager I boycotted a local movie theater because they wouldn't let us see an (unrated) comedy about lesbians because we were underage. I did my senior high school project on crossdressers. When one of my girls came out to me as bi (age 10), I celebrated her bravery in speaking about something difficult. When my older daughter came out as lesbian and later genderfluid, I was likewise relatively unfazed. However, when that same genderfluid daughter eventually came out to us as trans, suddenly I found myself confused and a bit ashamed of my own reaction. As well as one of acceptance and unconditional love, it was also one of loss and conflicting emotions. I never would have thought pronouns would make a big deal, but for some reason they're a mental hurdle that's been difficult to get used to. Also, I spent a long time and a lot of love picking out an original and feminine name, and now he goes by the commonest male name I can think of. Probably the hardest thing has been trying to understand the identity of someone who grew up female and identifies as male. It  threw me into a state of reexamination of what parts of his personality were really his and which parts were based on my perception of him. As an ally to the community, I felt like a failure for not being able to understand or identify. One of my friends gave me sh*t about my mixed reactions too which hurt me. It's different when it's a child you've borne than when you're speaking about a community at large. My family is super supportive too, which is great, but to a degree I want to fight to defend his honor -- but there's no one among my family to fight. It's another part of why it's been hard -- trying to fight an imaginary enemy. I know he's run into some hard times with his peers, and that's not good, and I get that, but nothing within the family. I asked him to talk with me the other day about being trans, and he rolled his eyes and said, ""yeah, Mom, I know what you're going to say, that you love me and support me no matter what."" I said, ""yes, but you have to understand it's hard for me, harder than I  thought, and I hope you'll forgive me if I hurt your feelings or don't understand. I will do my best, and of course I do love and support you, but I'm having a harder time dealing with it than I thought I would."" To both my ex-husband and me, he has said that he'll go back to being our little girl if we want him to, which honestly has made the situation even more difficult. So I'm learning everything I can.",Ugy0dPkl7XAGnykMHyh4AaABAg,0,0,2021-08-17T03:16:42Z,1

"Is gender dysphoria an at all similar feeling to body dysmorphia? I know it's not the same but I have a long history of anorexia but have gained weight in order to pursue my dream to become a doctor but I feel like my body is too big, there are bits of my body that I wish didn't exist and I wish like I could cut them off. Also when people say I'm not fat I can't believe them because my anorexia knows that I am. Obviously this is different because my logical, medical student brain knows that I am not overweight but for trans people, they are absolutely correct in their beliefs about their gender, but I was just wondering if any of these feelings might be somewhat similar",UgwA2WiUXpRk2nA3lux4AaABAg,2,1,2021-08-03T13:33:58Z,1

"Fun Facts: You are not a man. You were not born in a mans body. You don't know what its like to be a man. You will never know what its like to be a man. You will never be a man. If you're unhappy with who you are, getting a dick sewed on will not change that. Just because you take testosterone and say ""bro"" doesn't mean you're a dude. Being a guy is a lot more than tv characteristics and looks. Its one thing to relate to a characteristic of a male character you see on a tv show, but to reduce men to what you see on TV or in Mens magazines as the flawed ""definition"" of a man is shallow and to try and convince yourself that 'hey yeah, i can do that or act that way' will make you no more of a man that you already are.",UgzcDVkpzbGFGamfja14AaABAg,2,1,2021-05-18T14:07:50Z,1

"Im so glad i saw this video. I kinda understand a bit more, but i see theres other things i should learn to actually fully understand. Im a CIS male; he, his, him.. i like being male, but just cuz im male doesnt mean i HAVE to like what a MALE has to like, such as; sports, color blue, etc, but i do enjoy sports, art, and a variety of things. Everyone is different i get that, i just didnt have such an open mind as i thought i did, cuz this is complicated, stuff i didnt even think about. Anyways.. i guess im kinda questioning myself now... and idk why, cuz i do like being MALE. When i was younger, i have this very early memory that when i ran, i ran like a ""girl"" i thought. And i liked to pretend i had long hair, and when i played with dolls i always chose the FEMALE version dolls. People noticed this and made me feel very insecure. As i grew up i tried to change that cuz of what they said about me. But i do like being a MALE, so im way confused haha. I'll have to keep searching for knowledge, but i know itll be a while to do so, cuz im lazy to even click buttons, or mind tireness.

"For any Transpeople out there: Are you okay with people completely denying your former gender or should I acknowledge the gender you 'were' before if I talk about a past event? (I know someone and speaking of our childhood memories I'm never really sure if I should say him or her, since at that time he was in a girls body.) Also is the fact that you used to be in a different body 'important' to you, since you spend a huge part of your life in it

"For most of my life I've believed myself to be female. With some exceptions. I dont like using feminine pronouns -- I can ignore it but when I hear them in reference to me I get kind of uncomfortable. And I hate any sort of reference to ""female"" genitalia or ""female"" sexuality. Even when I was a kid I would say I barely counted as a woman, or that I was a failure of a girl because I wasn't feminine much at all. And though I have long hair,  to me it seems more masculine, like a metal heads long hair rather than a girls long hair. I don't like looking at my face and I'm most comfortable with people using thr male nickname for my name.

But at the same time, some days I'm more comfortable with looking feminine. And I like my breasts. I just hate anything below the belt. And it makes it really hard figuring out where I lie on the gender spectrum",Ugy8tRqq9dbI_5side54AaABAg,1,0,2017-08-16T20:43:45Z,1

"Another Example To Explain Social Dysphoria To A Cis Person Is To Take Something That They Identity As Very Strongly And Imagine That Noone Believes You. So For Example, If Someone Really Values Being An Honest Person, Ask Them To Imagine EVERYONE Saying They Were A Liar, Introducing Them To Others As ""The Liar"" And Every Time The Person Tells People They're Not Lying, Them Being Told They're Wrong, It Just Proves They're Lying And Maybe Even Getting Into Trouble For It.

This causes changes in the body, like male pattern hair growth, acne, weight gain, amenorrhea. Sometimes that makes me feel utterly shitty about my body and myself, even suicidal.

"As a cis, the best way that one of my friend (who is trans) explained it to me was: Imagine that you woke up the next morning with ""male genitals"" (if you're a cis woman) or ""female genitals"" (if you're a cis man). You look in the mirror and the body that you see doesn't match who you are. Now imagine that you went to the store and the cashier said, ""thank you ma'am"" or ""thank you sir"" and you knew they were wrong but nobody else saw you the way that you felt. And you had to navigate through life with people assuming you were something that you weren't. Essentially, if you woke up looking like a female then you wouldn't suddenly identify as a woman; you'd still be the same person. Now I've educated myself more on the subject and know that there's a lot more to it then that and that I will never completely understand but it was a breakthrough for me when it came to beginning to understand more.",UgxK4n8EEBHrAkeSUpJ4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-02T02:27:30Z,1

That as a cis person we cannot actually 100% understand how someone that's trans feels, but we can try and mentally grasp the concepts that they are trying to share with us, and believe that what they tell us about how they feel is true. It's amazing how people won't even educate themselves on the basics so that they can make informed decisions when it comes to things like voting, healthcare, etc for people.

"Some criticism: I agree with your general ideas but there are a few scenes I disagree with, or rather, would have worded differently. For example, the use of ""feel"", ""identify"", ""percieve"", ""gender identity"" and ""gender"". It's best not to use the words identify and feel because we don't identify or feel a gender. The only way you can feel male or female is the roles assigned, however we can generally ""feel"" that our sex is wrong, which is actually just dysphoria. I think it's best to not use the words gender or gender identity either  because they both refer to the social and cultural roles assigned to men and women, gender identity being which role you identify with the most and how you express that. As trans people, we know that this is not the case for us but we have been lead to believe that gender and gender identity is when our outside doesn't match the inside. However this description is inaccurate as gender has never referred to this, it's always referred to the social aspect. It would be much better to state that our sex does not match with who we are inside, hence dysphoria rather than our ""gender"". As you stated, this has nothing to do with gender non-conformity and by using the term gender, it just reinforces the idea that if you do not conform to your gender role, you are trans.",Ugx0RP4f7wMslAYBNwt4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-01T22:27:10Z,1

I don't want to claim something that people fight for everyday. this has been my battle since middle school.

"I really like the sweater analogy when it comes to explaining how you know you're trans. It goes as follows: you're shopping with someone (this person represents society). You're in the changing room with them, and they're forcing a sweater on you, but it's way too small, and way too thin. You've been eyeing another sweater the whole trip, and it looks wonderful, but Society is telling you that you can't have that one. You decide to try it on anyway, and it's comfy and warm and fits just right. Society is telling you over and over that it looks ugly and isn't right and it's too expensive and you might change your mind, but you buy it anyway, and it's absolutely perfect.

That's what being trans is like. You have this unexplainable knowledge that the jumper you were given just does not fit, and society is telling you all these lies about what you should and shouldn't do, but there's nothing you want more than that sweater and you just KNOW you have to have it. You can't hide it away or pretend it doesn't exist. It's an inescapable part of who you are.",Ugjh9pAGZDq-33gCoAEC,3,164,2017-08-01T23:56:09Z,1

I just want to leave maybe a more nuanced comment about what you said about ""it's when your outside doesn't match your inside"" : as a trans person, i believe that my outside matches my inside, because I'm non binary and my body isn't inherently gendered (since gender is a social construct). It's society that associate my appearance with being a woman, but my body is not inherently ""a woman's body""; it's just a body. And this association body <=> woman makes me feel bad and feel dysphoria. That's just my experience, and not every trans person feel this way, but I wanted to highlight this as the narrative of ""born in the wrong body"" is in my opinion a simplistic and reductive description of being trans and I wouldn't recommend to use it even in trans 101 as it perpetuates cissexist ideas about bodies (I'm not saying that Chase said ""born in the wrong body"" I'm just giving more details because ""your inside doesn't match your outside"" could easily make people think ""oh they're born in the wrong body then"").",Ugg6lrvuTRDGIngCoAEC,9,10,2017-08-01T12:23:09Z,1

Around those friends I feel so guilty cause if I call him he/him pronouns then it'll out him to his friends. He says to do it that way cause he doesn't want to come out to them yet. It still hurts me though cause I'm calling him something that labels him as a her. 
Because of the back and forth though sometimes I slip up. If I accidentally call him she/her pronouns by accident when we're alone I just move on and change the subject.",UgwdT5Twj9ZAdbARyXB4AaABAg,0,1,2019-02-11T21:24:11Z,1

27 seconds in and already you can distinguish an error in a presented argument, because males and females are not the product of Society, they are products of Evolution, to which He and She derived from, you're (what 30 years old?) trying to defy an astonishing number of 3.5 billion years of evolution that every living organism depends on to secure better chances of offspring and prolonged lifespan count and with what? With marxist-like, irrational, and self-victimizing approach of thinking that wants to put 3.5 billion years of evolution in the same box you were detesting just earlier!

"Hey chase, you said something about that us trans people often try to find validation by other people by them calling us the right pronouns, and that it might be a little problematic, but i dont think thats the reason why we want everyone to call us the right pronouns. I think its more like that we are for example male and we want other people to call us male; because we are. Not because we want to feel good about ourselves and feel valid, but just because we _are_. I dont want people to call me he because like lets say, they wanna make me feel good, like ""oh you feel like a boy let me be nice to you and call you he"". Its more like just with cis people we dont call them the right pronouns to validate them but just simply because those _are_ their pronouns.

"In my experience people found it harder to adjust to different pronouns than to a new name, even after my friends had gotten used to my new name and never messed that up they'd still get the pronouns wrong sometimes, I think that might be because they were thinking more about the name whereas pronouns are just automatic, we don't really think about them before we say them usually. 
It sucks when someone uses the wrong pronouns, but if I know they're trying and just made a mistake I don't mind nearly as much, especially if they correct themselves. 
Also I totally agree on not making a big deal of apologising, a quick sorry is good, but I'd rather no apology that a massive declaration about it.

"I remember going to a rally for my church youth group, and when we got back, my sponsor commended and thanked me for being so insistent and good about reminding/informing people on how to refer to me when it came to pronouns. At the rallies, you're split up into family groups, and the groups will be mixes of all the chapters. My sponsor was put in a group with a young trans boy, and any time they used ""she"" or ""her,"" the kid would just look annoyed. He didn't actually say ""please refer to me as male,"" he just expected everyone to know. Please, PLEASE don't do this. Don't expect people to know right away how to treat you. It's like expecting a doctor to know you're allergic to a certain medicine without telling them (okay maybe not that extreme, but you get it). Even if you're shy and don't feel comfortable speaking out like this, please don't be mad at people for making this mistake. They don't know they're making the mistake.

"I'm honestly very happy that you're pushing for a more understanding approach to being accidentally misgendered. I am a cis woman and have a friend that I have known since I was about 9-10 years old, and they used to go by he/him pronouns but recently told me that they identify as nonbinary. While my perception changed about them, as in I did not see them fall under the binary, it took some time to decondition myself from using the wrong pronouns and learning to use they/them. I think it's a matter of the mind most of the time. It's really reconditioning yourself to use the proper words. Your tip actually helped me out. I think you mentioned it in the Your So Brave podcast some episodes ago, and honestly I haven't made the mistake of misgendering them since then.
Also, I found that the best way to find out how to handle accidentally misgendering someone is by doing what you said: apologizing real quick on the spot and correct yourself, but I also think one should talk to the person on the side later and have a conversation on how they prefer you handle it.

"Another thing on disrespecting people's pronouns when you're mad at them: It makes it seem like a privilege to have the correct pronouns used. Like i'm good with you right now so i'll call you by what you want. But now i'm mad at you so you don't deserve the right pronouns. It also can make the person who is trans afraid to fight back because they know that if they say something against you, you'll hurt them emotionally by using the other pronouns/birth name.

"What about other pronouns besides he, they, or she? I have multiple people in my life (ages ranging from 15-45) who use ze/zir or ze/hir pronouns. I think its really important now to educate about pronouns outside of the binary. And since they/them pronouns are more well-known now, we need to start talking about other pronouns. I use they/them pronouns and its definitely more difficult for the people in my life who use ze/zir or ze/hir pronouns because its less known and people respect it even less, thinking that its a ""made up word"". All language is made up. All language has been developed in order to reflect our social world. Language is constantly evolving. All pronouns should be respected if those pronouns resonate with that person. A lot of people don't know how to use ze/zir pronouns and use ""they"" as a replacement. ""They"" is not that persons pronouns, so take the time to learn how to use ze/zir or whatever other pronoun that person goes by. Also, one of our trans elders, Leslie Feinberg, used ze/hir pronouns.

""It's important to gender a person correctly so they feel they pass as the gender.""

In the event the person does not pass and in public the person is misgendered, how do you feel this situation should be handled? Also, if a trans person asks, ""do I pass,"" is it ok to tell them ""no,"" in the event they don't yet pass (of course using the proper pronouns regardless)? I work with trans kids, many who don't pass, but constantly asked, ""do I pass?"" I personally feel honesty is important here to not set them up for disappointment in ""the real world.""

About misgendering when your angry at someone. Another reason and perhaps the main one for me that it is a huge taboo thing to do is that you are not just insulting the person you are angry at when you do it. In my mind you invalidate one you invalidate everyone. Just don't. Find other ways to be angry with someone sure. It happens.

I want to give a representation of pronouns as far as my life. I've literally been misgendered sense infancy. My mom has always corrected people that I was male sense I could remember. Growing up I used to do the same thing until I got older when I stopped correcting people about my pronouns. I've answered to both pronouns and I've used both pronouns to describe myself. I've embraced both pronouns because I'm seen as both pronouns. The empowerment comes from the correct usage of pronouns. In the beginning of my life I can understand how pronouns really do effect yo as a child growing up and why the correct pronouns gives affirmation and validation to that individual. It's always phenomenal to be called your correct pronouns and it's confirmation that your being supported. With neutral pronouns I've personally not used them yet because I've not met a gender neutral person but I welcome them when I do meet them. üòä,Ugy4WYKbnDrTYPCB0rx4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-05T16:09:14Z,1

"Important:

Purposely misgendering a trans person because you are annoyed at them / dislike them is never acceptable. It is transphobic. Using someone's pronouns correctly is not an act of kindness - it's just something you do.
If you were annoyed at a cisgender man, you wouldn't call him ""she"", would you? So don't do it with a transgender man.
It's not just offensive to that person, but to the entire transgender community, as it shows you only respect trans people's identities when you want to and shows that you think correct pronouns are something transgender people have to earn.

"I went to a PFLAG support meeting as an FTM person and heard a great way for dealing with people using the wrong pronoun (probably for people you are close to) called the ouch/oops.

Ask any man, cis included, whether they can pee sitting down, and you'll either receive a ""yes"" or they're super toxic and think men aren't allowed to (but they're still physically capable).

"ok guys help i'm trans (i thinkkkk??) but i'm going to a new school and its a christian all girls school and what do i do??? Like if i come out and start my transition will they kick me out? I'm also not entirely sure if i'm trans (f to m) or gender fluid. Like it always felt wrong when someone called me a girl. I've always been very tomboyish my whole life such as cutting my hair like a boy. I felt happy when someone mistakes me for a boy. I remember seeing boys being friends when i was like 6 and thinking it would be cooler and better to be a boy. It was always sorr of nagging me. Then i had some crushed on girls and though i was lesbian and now i'm realising i could just be a straight guy? When i began  puberty i hated my body so much!!

Idk whats going on but somebody help i'm 13 and abt to start high school.",Ugx4teQJiiP_CCLgntV4AaABAg,1,0,2022-01-10T11:48:42Z,1

"I would like to say I think the assigned at birth gender in some cases is right until they suffer some trauma so there are those I don't believe are born a certain gender and some who had more masculine as a assigned at birth female who is a male really. Its a different for all, some its genes or chemical exposure in childhood or by parents before they were born, some like myself (I was ok being a girl for awhile but after enduring abuse or threats on my life simply because I was a girl and they were obsessed with me or stalking me, when I felt suffciated I became non-binary because I felt afraid to have a gender, I wanted to be seen as something desirable for mind alone and people get too fixated on genders and straight bi, pan, gay, queer, etc labels I just wanted to be see as a person just a person. I do not think Jammi was born to stay a girl at all, even as a teen in that old pic he looked a little odd, like he was a boy dressed up not a girl really, so I think its just soemthing his dna gave him, too much masculine hormones in the womb or whatever but there are a variety of reasons a person becomes a transitioning person, and all are equally legitimate reasons (unless its like my therapist told me about with the one man who was so distraught about the death of his only relative his mother that he wanted to become her in essence but I have been in a lot of therapy and only once heard of a situation liek that therapist mentioned, that is why its important to seek therapy and advice from those who have experience in their own life with this kind of situation, however I bless you all and hope that no one for whatever reasons is denied the right to be who they need to be. Much love to all and I wish you all as easy and gentle a transition or change of gender in terms only whichever is able to travel whichever their path may be, and its not just abut happiness but often a relief of a feeling of being wrong with what your outside depicts. Sorry if this doesn't make sense I wrote this  when I hadnt had much sleep and I don't have a good grasp of English anymore since an accident years ago brought me brain injury anyway just meant to say some of us are not born this way but it doesnt make our journey any less valid or real.

It‚Äôs not like your new penis is functional. It doesn‚Äôt look like a male penis, it doesn‚Äôt ejaculate, you cannot stimulate it by touching it, etc.

If your partner wants to have intercourse, just strap on a strapon.

"@Jammidodger and anyone else who has an opinion on this:
A couple disclaimers
1. I am not trans
2. I am ignorant on this topic and that's why I would appreciate some opinions on it. Although I understand that the research behind the surgeries are extensive and after watching a couple of medical videos on it, it seems pretty safe (as safe as like the opposite like a hysterectomy)

3. I know this is a very complicated topic and it depends on the person, but...

I was wondering what your opinion on what age transgender people should be able to give consent getting this surgery?
Is there already a minimum age requirement?

An additional disclaimer:
4. If and when I decide I want children and one or all of them figure out that they are trans (or a part of the LGBTQ community in general, I want to support them in any way possible) the same way with something like a tattoo (which is more of a form of an expression than dealing with constant dysphoria), I don't want my kid to commit to something that they might regret in the future.

I'll tell you why:
1) you don't make these videos to be helpful
2) you make these videos to get a rise out of people, or to just plain get attention.
3) you like to talk on public videos about your pseudo-penis because you are a just plain inappropriate person who likes to talk about his penis in public videos for all the world to see.
4) you make these videos, talking all about your penis, BECAUSE YOU ARE ON AN ADDICTIVE DRUG aka Testosterone, which makes you OVERSEXED and probably an addict like NoahFinnce and your oversexed addicted life will be a total wreck in a few years.",UgzOm18x5a-7AqUm9L94AaABAg,11,0,2020-06-30T02:41:58Z,1

"So like seemingly everyone here, I have no idea why YouTube recommended this to me. I'm a cis guy, last time I was interested in LGBTQ+ issues was at least a year ago, and my trans friends can be counted on one hand - Safe to say, I am not the main demographic for this kind of content.

But I'm so glad that it _is_ being recommended. YouTube has a bad habit of half-hiding content they deem ""non-advertiser friendly"", so a lot of videos regarding transgendered and homosexual people isn't being seen by those who need it, such as young LGBT-identifying folks.

Overall, your channel seems like a great resource for those who need it, and I'm glad YouTube is allowing it to be seen :)",Ugz1E9FQSkJKM1bzmNZ4AaABAg,8,1106,2020-05-05T22:54:21Z,1
"Wow! I am, happily, shocked the NHS pays for all the surgery of transitioning! Here in the US with our shyt health ""insurance"" I believe it's considered ""unnecessary"" and therefor the patient has to pay for everything, which I heard is a shocking amount. Thanks for answering everyone's questions so frankly without any apologies or embarrassment. I've been queried by friends on sex questions, and have always been honest, open, and unembarrassed. Too many people in our society are freaked out about questions about sex and sexuality instead of handling it like a matre adult. People just generally want to know because they are curious, don't know, just exploring etc., so it's really not big deal-- in the right setting. I'm against people springing questions on famous grand people about their genitals, I mean I don't ask how a cis person's genitals look like, why in an interview would one just feel free to ask an trains person and yet it still is an often asked question, like its normal, like asking how one's day is...

"I watch so many of Jamis videos and honestly if I hadn‚Äôt watched his transformation video I would have NEVER thought he was trans. Like I would argue about it and bet money that he was born male. His voice, looks, just everything fits him so perfectly!. Before I didn‚Äôt understand how trans people really felt, I felt for them my heart would ache hearing stories of how they feel. I can‚Äôt watch too much of RuPauls drag race because all of their stories are so sad and I just sit there and cry with them. After watching jamis videos I realized THIS is what everyone means by they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfit‚Äù or that wasn‚Äôt them being their gender. Jami is a boy and was meant to be a boy just like the girls were meant to be girls. I get it. And I‚Äôm beyond happy that they finally get to live life, what hurts me is that all of those years of them being in their natural born gender were lost and now they get to live life. No one and I mean NO ONE deserves that, time is such an ugly beautiful thing. I absolutely love watching transformation videos because their pain is clearly shown in the beginning and post op every single one of those people have such a beautiful glow to them, their eyes twinkle with hope and happiness. I always do my best to not complain about anything because there‚Äôs always someone fighting such an ugly battle. To all my trans family you did it!! And if you haven‚Äôt gone through the change?

Size does not matter. As long as it makes you happy and it conforms with you  identifying  as a man. Which you are a full man. Glad you got your gender conformation. I am not a transgender  person  but am an advocate. And whether people wonder if you sit or stand to pee it does not matter. At the end of the day you are a man and personally as someone who has a boyfriend who misses the toilet more times than I can count I would rather teach him to sit to Pee. I have watched some of your YouTube videos and I just want to say that is your generation that will help the lbgqt community to be more open and to just be themselves which is what anyone wants whatever they identify as. As I always say love Is love. And again at the end of the day we have to be happy with herself and be happy with Who We are. As I have said I am an advocate for the lbgqt community but I cannot believe that we still have to fight 4 people's rights to be who they are. So yes I'm an advocate but I'm also just a person who believes in human rights and at the end of the day whoever we identify as we are all human. May one day we just all accept each other for Who We Are regardless of what we identify as or who we love. I hope you keep up your videos as they are very informative and like I said you are the generation that can make change.,UgzB8tU4zIFKDzJcCG94AaABAg,0,0,2020-03-15T18:35:30Z,1

"I have watched all your videos for the last couple of years as my son is F2M. I wanted to learn more and understand his emotions more. I have to thank you so much as you have taught me so much. You have been so informative and I just love your relationship with your fianc√©. I can only hope that my son finds the love you both have for each other. That‚Äôs just me being a worrying mother üòÇ. You appear to be a really thoughtful person and I thank you once more for what you have done for Trans people and worrying parents like me. You have made this so much easier for me. My son has top surgery in April and I know he will feel more confident once it is done. So excited for him! Much love for you both xx
UPDATE - He was so happy when he had top surgery but since September he has tried to commit suicide and now is on serious drugs that we are helping him get off hopefully for the 2nd time. He is hurting and feels that no one accepts him out side the house. It‚Äôs really hard but we will get him through this and all I can hope for is that he accepts himself. He knows he is loved but whether he feels it is another matter! üòû
Update - he has since been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism So is on medication. This has helped him a lot to understand himself. Now wonder he was stressed out. He now has been clean for a while and although still gets depressed he is not so hard on himself. Also being on Testosterone changes his hormones as well as his moods. He is doing so well and I‚Äôm as proud of him and his brother for handling everything so well. My boys do me proud! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Ugz_f3SC-hdH-4qg2Bh4AaABAg,15,80,2021-11-08T07:36:37Z,1

"Honestly, it depends largely on the surgeon performing the procedure. I'm an RN, and ive seen some...horrendous work before. Working in the ER, i have also seen some nasty infections from people trying to save money by going to certain...discount medical care countries...which i wont name because the internet doesnt much tolerate negative things about these places...


I have also seen some incredible surgeries where i wasnt even aware that a transition surgery had taken place until being told.


As a rule, with any surgery...if they are offering to do it for a massive discount compared to other surgeons...buyer beware...


Also, congrats on a successful transition (so far) and keep your head up. Some of my favorite people have GD (including my little sister, but that whole situation is complicated, so she might become my brother at some point. It is her preference that we continue with female pronouns until/if she undergoes transition surgery, so all those who want to get on my case about using the wrong pronouns, back it up)",UgyPGWENVsgyXWDJJaV4AaABAg,0,0,2019-12-12T14:53:02Z,1

"I don't know why anyone would think 7-8 inches is an average sized penis. Five inches is average. There are some bigger and some smaller. Men tend to be proportionate. If he's pretty tall he'll usually be a little bigger. If he's under five feet tall he'll be a little smaller. Who the hell wants ten inches? That could cause damage. Not to mention most bigger guys don't know what the hell they're doing. They think size will do it. Wouldn't you rather have a guy who knew what to do, how to use it and cares if you're happy about it? Ignore the weirdos and do what makes you happy.

"I have seen so many comments here saying Trans isn't real or ""Accepting trans people won't make this a better world"" 

I am gender fluid and pansexual. And it drives me crazy when people post hate comments. What do I think of these comments exactly? I think that those are both opinions and because it is 2019 they're both wrong. Everyone is so focused on the LGBTQ+ Community that we don't see the real problems. Sure, spend your time putting hate comments on social media and protest our rights, you do you. But I'm just saying that what they do with their life doesn't have any effect on yours. It is a choice to let their beliefs and choices interfere with your time and life. You won't agree with everything in your generation. My opinion on the matter? Live and let live. For all of you Christians discriminating us, just stop. God is the only one that is allowed to judge us. Let's just agree that humanity sucks, no one will ever get along,  and society is always going to be broken and live on.",UgxRJqRqIOnDU_ZNX2t4AaABAg,0,3,2019-10-19T01:36:55Z,1

"There are things i don't understand with gender dysphoria and the transpeople. 
Why do transmen, all around the world, transition into what the west think a 20th or 21st century male is like? There are many cultures around the world where males wear what would be considered women's clothing by the west. Even ancient greek and roman men would wear what normally a woman would wear today. I've tried to search for a transmen with long hair on youtube but couldn't find one. They all have short hair. Men do grow their hair. Men have always had long hair. So why do all transmen have short hair and facial hair (a small amount don't have facial hair), at least on youtube? It's like they are trying to become a caricatural male. No variation whatsoever. 
Even with choosing names. What if names, from the beginning of time, were neutral. A name won't make someone become more male or female. A feminine gay man with a male name will still be gay and feminine.
Now transpeople have gender dysphoria and once they transition, the GD goes away (i get this from a trans who commented on another video). How does the GD go away? Your body will always be what it was at birth, even with cosmetic surgeries. Not even CRISPR can do something about that (could be wrong). So how does transitioning help? From my point of view, it's like playing pretend. Cause for a transmen, for eg, just having short hair is the same as going through a wardrobe change, taking hormones, having surgeries. The birth body will remain the birth body. Same applies for transwomen. Normally the GD shouldn't not go away. And if it does, transpeople might as well have tried living as biological males or females and follow a therapy for the GD.
Most trans people are born in a healthy and normal body. Yet it's the body that has to change, through a painful process, to fit what's in the mind. It seems really extreme. What if tomorrow, someone came up with a pill to totally cure gender dysphoria? No more feeling being in the wrong body. Would trans people take it? Wouldn't that be the reasonable choice?
I'm trying to UNDERSTAND, NOT ATTACK AND HURT, the trans community. So if you reply to my comment, please be civil.",UgwM6-gd8LtDehx3E3h4AaABAg,4,0,2019-09-19T03:36:33Z,1

"The person who thinks 10 inches is possible with phallo is seriously misinformed and clueless about male biology. The average biological penis is like 5.8 inches or maybe even 5.6.
Having 8 inches is incredibly unlikely, and the phallus cannot shrink and get erect (without an implanted device), it is constantly the same size. You would need a permanently stiff rod in it, so constantly having 7 stiff inches either angled up, or down just wouldn't be practical. It would likely result in the rod splitting through the flesh or corroding the flesh around it. Or, the other option is the pump device, which has loads of flaws as well. That doesn't remove the 7 inches of flesh that you constantly have to flop around so it is in a comfortable position.

Erectile implants have to be replaced, and it has a high risk of infection, to the point that the entire phallus needs to be amputated.
Phalloplasty horror stories are worth looking into before you consider getting it. It most likely, is not worth it.",UgzSnuGmHW556_3zRO14AaABAg,0,22,2019-09-18T18:43:54Z,1

"Ive been questioning my gender for some months now. The past weeks I have found that my dysphoria has gotten worse the more I start accepting?/questioning if I'm trans. Like, I'll get really happy and euphoric when imagining myself as a boy and then I'll get really sad and stuff when I ask myself ""what if I'm actually cis, what if I'm a g i r l?"". I have other mental issues so its even harder and Im just really confused but also I kind of want to accept that Im trans, and am a boy but then I start doubting myself and start crying because I get so anxious. What if I'm pretending? Is it too early to know? God, I am so confused. I tell myself that I should wait until I feel better mentally (I'm in a very depressive episode, have been for the past weeks) and then I can see if I'm actually trans or if I have been mistaken. Gaaah I just really dont wanna be wrong about this, I have social anxiety so I super wanna be sure of myself before I come out to my school or my family. I have told my closest friend that I think I'm trans and I have given them my new name and that feels so great! But I'm still in a lot of pain the more I long for getting to transition and the more I watch others live happily as who they are. Gah this is frustrating.

".. I'm 11, so it's going to be 5 years before I'm allowed to go on T. I've battled on and off with depression due to the dysphoria. One thing that I've found is that I get really envious. Since all of my friends are boys, I get really jealous of them and the fact that they are growing like regular teenage boys. My main issue though, is my face shape and figure. I only have B cups, but binding hurts my chest. And yes before any of you ask it was the right size. KT Tape pulls my skin off when I remove it, and theresnothing I can do to alleviate the dysphoria from my face shape. Is there anyone in the comments section in a similar situation as me with any advice to offer a fellow struggling trans guy?",Ugg5crd397anbXgCoAEC,4,23,2017-07-01T19:53:46Z,1
"I'm not sure if I'm trans or not but I'm always feeling more like a guy and I just never really feel like a girl but I do wear boys clothes and act more masculine and I feel so much better as my male side of who I have named ""Levi"" who uses male pronouns and is a guy overall but my female side (my biological sex) ""Chloe"" who is a girl and  is supposed to love more feminine things. (Sorry if that last part sounds weird but I didn't know how else to put it). I have semi long hair but it's super thick and I absolutely hate it cause it's super hard to manage. It's the main reason I have dysphoria but my parents say ""no you'll look like a boy"" I can't tell them because I'm not completely sure myself yet and I'm still so many years away from even being able to seem to have an opinion about my hair around my parents. If I were to cut it I feel as if my parents (mainly my dad) would freak out and my dad would probably break something in the house and most likely hit me. He's slapped me across the face 4 times on Christmas leaving bleeding cuts in my mouth from my braces from not washing my hands after touching a ball that had glitter on it. I feel like they really wouldn't support me if I were to be trans anyway I can't tell my dad anything in fear I might end up in the hospital and him end up in jail. I've been asking for just a pixie cut that goes up to my nose for 3 years and now he only makes fun of me and gets hostile over the fact of me asking for a normal haircut. I've actually started cutting and crying myself to sleep some nights because of how much my dysphoria has effected me along with all my other disorders that I can't get help for because they will only make fun of me for having. I'm still really young and feel like ending my life almost every day I really need some help on how to convince my parents to let me get a pixie cut before everything gets so much worse.",UgiMmhJvP4BR-3gCoAEC,3,3,2017-06-02T03:00:52Z,1
