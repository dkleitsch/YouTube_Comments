"So I relate to what you were saying about being a woman and non binary. I don't like being referred to as a girl by other people despite being born a female but I don't necessarily feel I fit identifying as a male either. This is where I become confused because I don't think I'm quite gender fluid as I don't move between both genders, I'm either neutral and don't choose to identify as a specific gender or I fit the gender identify of woman in terms of how I look etc. Would this make me a non binary woman then?

"I learned I was Asexual at the age of 54, two years ago. Aromantic as well, but I felt still somewhat off... until I bit the bullet yesterday and began to look at label definitions. When I read about Non-Binary it struck home. I consider myself a woman who is non-binary though I definitely feel stuck in the middle. I am not attracted to heterosexual romance stories, or Lesbian or even Bisexual stories, or relationships, but I am very attracted to and can feel on a soul-level the male bonding scenarios of both Straight and Gay males. I write Bromance stories, as well as Gay Romance (minus the sex, something I finally understood when realizing I was an Asexual on my particular level.) I never felt truly feminine, or truly masculine. Though I do carry more feminine areas than masculine... at times. :D So, right now I'm still learning about Non-Binary areas and your video here absolutely helped me grasp more clarity on the subject. Thank you so much for such in-depth information. I can now officially say I identify as a woman who is Non-Binary. :D",Ugz3vUdmWVQAkhBmlNx4AaABAg,12,283,2019-04-05T21:09:13Z,3

I don't see why everybody gets upset if you pronounce what they identify as improperly why can't it just be Shrugged off? You expect us to be open-minded to your side but by the same token you get upset if we don't identify you properly. So yes it is correct to let the person know that you don't identify as what they called you but don't get upset that people that don't live in your life understands the proper terminology.,Ugxsacf1TZf0YU_Buht4AaABAg,0,3,2018-08-17T23:59:46Z,3

"I have ZERO respect for Riley Dennis and this is why.

Riley is a genuinely awful and narcisstic person who takes every critique as a personal attack and refuses to even engage in dialogue as she has admitted in videos with Ashley for example (I think that's her name) Constantly acts as an apologist for violent terrorist groups such as antifa, labels misgendering as <""violence"" claims that people having a preference is ""transphobic"" and so on. Even when one of her biggest critiques came out and apologized she had the AUDACITY to make an absolute insane video ""how to apologize"" I have ZERO respect for riley dennis but I will call her HER cus im being kind. People does not hate Riley for what she is, rather for her absolutely insane beliefs. Im so sick of trans ppl considering every form of critique to be ""hate"" and take it a sa personal attack. Grow up. Riley is no different from a crazy neo nazi or islamist. They are both equally retarded in their own beliefs.

It's women like you that make our society less afraid of people who are different than them.
So, once again- thank you! I learn from your videos so much.
When I first met a trans person that didn't came out to her parents yet, I really didn't know how to address to them. It took time for me and I was really afraid to say something that might hurt them.
I could use these videos than. But I didn't.

"You are so, so articulate. Thank you for the work you did in making this video and for making a person questioning their gender not feel out of place because I haven't necessarily seen someone with the same exact story as mine. I haven't really seriously thought about my gender before I guess... But suddenly I've started experiencing gender dysphoria at the age of 21 while never experiencing it before at any point in my life that I can remember, and now I'm looking back and like my favorite songs in middle school were Androgyny and Cherry Lips by Garbage, which both definitely deal with trans themes imo. I'm thinking maybe I just never seriously thought about my gender before until like a month ago so I never really thought it might not be best for me? Until I started thinking about how much better I'd feel in social situations being a woman... So I think I've always had the euphoria (when I was little I used to 'play ballet' in my room with piano music), I just never put two and two together that what I really enjoyed in doing those activities  was the idea of filling a (very stereotypical) social role of what I thought it meant to be a woman back then. As I grew up those activities were kind of stamped out of me by my family, relatives, and church, so I really honestly forgot I could experience those feelings because I was always perceived as being a man. I just always felt like there was something missing, I mean if I am a man (ugh I hate this process) then I'm gay, so I thought that that was what I was missing, but I still would just have these deep-seated angers at random points about having to engage with strangers and friends as a man in every social situation and it was getting tiresome. I shoved it down as far as I could and would hang out with pretty bro-ish people (even though I didn't act super broey myself), even during college tho I expanded my circles to more feminine-presenting people then and realized that I was missing out on a lot of fun just being able to be myself 100%.

Now two things are making me start to experience this childhood gender euphoria I almost forgot about... 1. is my hair. The more I've grown it out the more I feel... just... right. Like I never noticed there was something off but now that I'm experiencing it there is something definitely off. And 2. is trying makeup. Once I started putting it on (with some friends) I just felt like this intense happiness that I was doing something to present as more feminine. Since these things are happening that might be why I'm ""suddenly"" experiencing dysphoria?

And I'm not even sure still if I am a woman 100%",UgxCJfLVT_YuRGaQdkB4AaABAg,0,5,2019-10-31T05:46:17Z,3

"Not sure if I missed this point in the video, but if anyone could help, I would really appreciate it! My ex has publicly come out as trans, changed their name and identifies trans masculine(to my knowledge, we are not in contact so all this is from FB and common friends). But during our relationship, I called them my girlfriend. Now, when I talk about this relationship and my experience within it(in therapy, with friends who bring it up, relatives etc), I am not sure how refer to them. Obviously I use the correct pronouns(they/them) and real name(correcting friends who use their dead name) but this term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô still slips out as for during most of the relationship I viewed them as a woman and we were a ‚Äòlesbian couple‚Äô and therefore I am not sure how to replace it. I don‚Äôt want to say boyfriend because as someone who dates multiple genders it just doesn‚Äôt feel right(doesn‚Äôt honour my sexual fluidity and experiences) and terms like partner seem too serious for the nature of our relationship. Of course mostly I just use the term ex, but especially when I tend to talk about my own sexuality and experiences the term girlfriend is easiest to determine the nature of this specific relationship. To clear up, they did begin questioning and partly transitioning at the end of our relationship and then my ex still preferred me calling them by the term ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô.

Not sure if that made any sense, but I appreciate any help as I want to learn how to be a better ally and, regardless of our differences, respect my ex and their gender.

She‚Äôs said that she transitioned because she knew she would be happier, because she wasn‚Äôt happy with her gender. And while there were some elements of dysphoria (she‚Äôs also talked about realising that if she didn‚Äôt transition, she‚Äôd have to grow old as a gender that didn‚Äôt fit, and that was extremely uncomfortable for her), she‚Äôs also said that she doesn‚Äôt have specific dysphoria relating to her body. 

I would recommend her videos as well, though it‚Äôs important to understand she often engages in dialectic argument through characters, neither of which necessarily reflect her view. And she often delves into the philosophy of things, which doesn‚Äôt always reflect the reality of many trans folk. It‚Äôs still an interesting way to get some more viewpoints though.",UgwFiN8QKYuRls1AAY94AaABAg,1,4,2019-08-18T21:11:02Z,3

"Thank you for describing non-binary. As someone who identifies as non-binary it‚Äôs nice to have some who isn‚Äôt non-binary explaining it and talking about it. Also the issue of dead-naming/pronouns is very important to trans people. I don‚Äôt feel like I was born in the wrong body (this doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have some physical dysphoria, it just means I don‚Äôt find my body to be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù), so thank you for talking about that also.",UgwlNIkir0RFWuJ-Yrx4AaABAg,0,4,2019-08-18T18:24:36Z,3

"Great video. For the person asking about how Trans people choose a new name for themselves. Since you using that for a fictional character, it would be a good idea to take what the character is as an individual and couple that with the different ways Riley has described to choose how that character chooses a new name, since gender is just one part of a miriad of things that makes up an individual.",UgxKK33nIF30H47Ct4F4AaABAg,1,15,2019-08-18T17:56:55Z,3

"also idk why but at every job i've held i've gotten a talking to about not using ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" when talking with customers. i'm not talking about ""excuse me, ma'am"" when calling out to a customer (this occurs more frequently in retail than fast food and the latter is where i've always worked) but just talking to them at a register and saying, ""your order will be ready in a moment. thank you"" instead of ""your order will be ready in a moment. thank you, sir.""",UgylO8R4C0jIQNDjTRZ4AaABAg,0,0,2019-08-18T16:19:30Z,3

"I'm an early transition girl and honestly im really glad you made this video for a few reasons, i can show this to my parents and friends that don't quite get it yet, lucky for me unlike a lot of trans people (that i can't help but feel sorry for them) my dad is fine with it just confused still. 2nd reason is that I personally never understood Non-Binary as a concept but this really helps me get their thoughts, personally won't 100% understand cuz I've never felt like neither M or F, I've always been a girl so I won't know what's that like to think like and the 3rd reason is because this answers questions I never fully know how to answer to people who ask me about being trans, thanks Riley <3",Ugyea2Qsk3xNRRLxBUd4AaABAg,0,10,2019-08-18T16:00:04Z,3
