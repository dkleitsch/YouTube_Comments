I understood and granted my coworkers the necessary grace period to get used to the adjustment period.  After all, we'd worked together for 3+ years, and I was willing to give them thay adjustment period . . .",Ugw6HUUIBxnaj3S9U9x4AaABAg,0,0,2022-02-28T23:35:30Z,none

8,"Watching this video series with Swedish subtitles on, to see if it's ""good enough"" to send my parents. I'm so damn happy and feel so validated that whomever subtitled this uses both our words for ""they"" (de/hen)! I personally prefer the ""plural"" they in singular (works the same as english they), but I've literally never heard anyone else use it & I just find it so awkward when people use our, still too new word, ""hen"" (singular they, invented in the 60's, but didn't start getting used by ""all"" until this century)

Not because we want to feel good about ourselves and feel valid, but just because we _are_. I dont want people to call me he because like lets say, they wanna make me feel good, like ""oh you feel like a boy let me be nice to you and call you he"".

83,"In my experience people found it harder to adjust to different pronouns than to a new name, even after my friends had gotten used to my new name and never messed that up they'd still get the pronouns wrong sometimes, I think that might be because they were thinking more about the name whereas pronouns are just automatic, we don't really think about them before we say them usually. 
It sucks when someone uses the wrong pronouns, but if I know they're trying and just made a mistake I don't mind nearly as much, especially if they correct themselves. 
Also I totally agree on not making a big deal of apologising, a quick sorry is good, but I'd rather no apology that a massive declaration about it. What I really hate is when someone goes into a whole speech about how difficult it is for them because they've known me for years as she and it's so hard and all that...

At the rallies, you're split up into family groups, and the groups will be mixes of all the chapters. My sponsor was put in a group with a young trans boy, and any time they used ""she"" or ""her,"" the kid would just look annoyed. He didn't actually say ""please refer to me as male,"" he just expected everyone to know. Please, PLEASE don't do this. Don't expect people to know right away how to treat you. It's like expecting a doctor to know you're allergic to a certain medicine without telling them (okay maybe not that extreme, but you get it).

I am a cis woman and have a friend that I have known since I was about 9-10 years old, and they used to go by he/him pronouns but recently told me that they identify as nonbinary. While my perception changed about them, as in I did not see them fall under the binary, it took some time to decondition myself from using the wrong pronouns and learning to use they/them. I think it's a matter of the mind most of the time. It's really reconditioning yourself to use the proper words. Your tip actually helped me out. I think you mentioned it in the Your So Brave podcast some episodes ago, and honestly I haven't made the mistake of misgendering them since then.
Also, I found that the best way to find out how to handle accidentally misgendering someone is by doing what you said: apologizing real quick on the spot and correct yourself, but I also think one should talk to the person on the side later and have a conversation on how they prefer you handle it.

All pronouns should be respected if those pronouns resonate with that person. A lot of people don't know how to use ze/zir pronouns and use ""they"" as a replacement.

""It's important to gender a person correctly so they feel they pass as the gender.""

In the event the person does not pass and in public the person is misgendered, how do you feel this situation should be handled? Also, if a trans person asks, ""do I pass,"" is it ok to tell them ""no,"" in the event they don't yet pass (of course using the proper pronouns regardless)? I work with trans kids, many who don't pass, but constantly asked, ""do I pass?"" I personally feel honesty is important here to not set them up for disappointment in ""the real world."" This has actually become such an issue we've had to ban the question, ""do I pass?""",UgwxJnnzATvGBbim_It4AaABAg,2,6,2017-08-05T18:29:36Z,none

146,About misgendering when your angry at someone. Another reason and perhaps the main one for me that it is a huge taboo thing to do is that you are not just insulting the person you are angry at when you do it. In my mind you invalidate one you invalidate everyone. Just don't. Find other ways to be angry with someone sure. It happens. But avoid misgendering period.,UgzcdGaCbkKBy0063jJ4AaABAg,5,24,2017-08-05T17:39:14Z,none

152,I want to give a representation of pronouns as far as my life. I've literally been misgendered sense infancy. My mom has always corrected people that I was male sense I could remember. Growing up I used to do the same thing until I got older when I stopped correcting people about my pronouns. I've answered to both pronouns and I've used both pronouns to describe myself. I've embraced both pronouns because I'm seen as both pronouns. The empowerment comes from the correct usage of pronouns. In the beginning of my life I can understand how pronouns really do effect yo as a child growing up and why the correct pronouns gives affirmation and validation to that individual. It's always phenomenal to be called your correct pronouns and it's confirmation that your being supported. With neutral pronouns I've personally not used them yet because I've not met a gender neutral person but I welcome them when I do meet them. üòä,Ugy4WYKbnDrTYPCB0rx4AaABAg,0,0,2017-08-05T16:09:14Z,none

Purposely misgendering a trans person because you are annoyed at them / dislike them is never acceptable. It is transphobic. Using someone's pronouns correctly is not an act of kindness - it's just something you do.
If you were annoyed at a cisgender man, you wouldn't call him ""she"", would you? So don't do it with a transgender man.
It's not just offensive to that person, but to the entire transgender community, as it shows you only respect trans people's identities when you want to and shows that you think correct pronouns are something transgender people have to earn.
