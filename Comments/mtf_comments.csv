"I'm curious what it was that made you think that you needed the bottom surgery. I've looked at the bit of statistics that i can find and there are tons of males that are attracted to mtf trans , but very , very few are interested in a mtf transgirl  that has had the surgery. I    know a fair amount of males who are very trans attracted , but all of them are totally turned off by the bottom surgery. So if any trans girl is getting the surgery to get guys it seems to be a counter productive surgery to get. On the other hand if it is just for their own personal mental needs to feel more female , i'm also curious how that makes one feel more female. And i mean this sincerely , can this be explained to me. To me one's genitalia is not the deal maker for being female. So i personally don't see the need to take such a huge risk and perhaps mutilating oneself. I'm glad you did this video and hope that you perhaps follow up by doing more on this subject and perhaps talk to other transgirl's to explore their thoughts on the matter and perhaps identify what drives someone to take such a drastic measure. But most of all is it really necessary and why is the such dysphoria over genitals which are something that should give pleasure and not mental anguish. This to me is one of the two main problems for transwomen. The other being how to make life easier for males who are trans attracted to admit their attraction. If it was easier for them then that would also solve huge issues for transwomen.",UgxWuqG4Atg3pg5JjqZ4AaABAg,0,0,2019-07-16T03:39:36Z,2

I'll always wonder if I'd have a better result and not feel regret if I cancelled, took the time I needed to figure out what was the right path for me and not what others demanded.

I will let you in to a secret. GRS was hard to get done yrs ago when i did mine over 3 decades ago there was a much stricter criteria. Lots of us who did GRS many decades ago. Did so then some of stayed around a few yrs to help other following behind us the same as other had before us, Then disappeared in to the woodwork and got on with our lives as woman.   Nowadays lots live to be trans and never move on. You will never get a true rate of success and regret because lots go unseen.  They fixed their problem and moved on. Which was the whole point in the surgery.  I recently had a 3hr conversation with police officers at my home. The 1st thing i told them is you do not have to feel like your stepping on eggshells around me.   I'm not part of the new wave trans movement. Who will go apeshit if a wrong word or phrase is used.  I think that's why we chatted so long as they had lots of question. They did ask me if i would come talk to the police force and educate them on a side of being Transexul they had not encounted before.  I explained i would rather not and gave my reason why.  I personally feel there will be more regretting surgery now than those from decades ago.",UgyaB299jw4Pn2cuxHJ4AaABAg,0,2,2019-04-12T23:04:21Z,2

"Great video Gigiüòä Very informative with a realistic message. That's what I love about you. You've found your happiness & that's all that counts. You're no more or less of a woman with or without the bottom surgery. You still deserve the same level of love, support, kindness, & basic respect reguardless. I'm a mtf (age 22) 6 months into HRT, laser hair removal & cosmetic aspects. Not sure if I'll get full gender/sex reassignment surgery or not? Might do part 1 then wait years for part 2. Looking into it though. I'm torn it's 50/50. Deep down yes, it is something I want. But I have a bit of fear of the risks/pain. It is a scary intense surgery. It would just be for me & nobody else. Sometimes I'm like why fix something that's not broken? Plus it costs the most money. It's the only part of transitioning that's expensive. But some health insurances do cover it more & more. I'm for sure getting a bilateral orchiectomy though. Most Drs recommend it due to being on t blockers too long causes blood clots & organ failure. So once testosterone is premanently gone you can lower estrogen & go off blockers. Less risks!  It's been a long courageous battle for me but I'm on the transition path. Thanks to love & support from my wonderful family & amazing medical care. We all only live one life. It's important to be happy, healthy & comfortable in our own bodies.
The truth is there is no right or wrong way to transition. Society places labels & expectations on trans people. 
Best of luck to you Gigi no matter what you decide we all care & support you‚ù§Ô∏è",UgzOvw2MuCmmt1c0Gp14AaABAg,0,0,2019-03-17T15:36:52Z,2

"Although I THOUGHT you had gone thru the surgery YEARS ago, I'm glad to find out you didn't but above all are honest and vocal about it because I can't tell you how many times I heard ""I'll never be perfect like Gigi, I can't get the surgeries done etc etc etc"" so I KNOW for a fact this video will reassure a LOT of trans women, that they can be as gorgeous as you without the damn surgery...as YOU YOURSELF don't even have it contrary to popular belief. I'm sure if you did a poll (don't lol) people would say they thought you had gender reassignment years ago. It's crazy. It's almost like a Mandela effect because a lot of folk even remember you saying it, which again is crazy cuz you obviously have not said it. So THANK YOU for being so open and candid (which you do NOT have to be)...I'm sure this will help a lot of women, trans and otherwise, who think of themselves less because of not having done or having been able to do whatever surgery, in this case reassignment surgery.

"You're gorgeous regardless, but this hair color is sooooo you. It gives you a very soft and elegant appearance. A friend of mine had gender reassignment surgery about 4 years ago and she is loving it. I watched her go through so much research, therapy, consultations, and years of saving up money to see her dream of becoming her true self. Just going through the beginning stages, hormone therapy, implants, some minor facial reconstruction to give her face a more feminine appearance, her personality and attitude shined even brighter. I also loved the fact that she has so much support from her family friends. We also worked together, and a huge to do was made when she came back to work (after taking a mental health leave to get a handle on what she would be dealing with) meetings were held in each department with our supervisors explaining what transgender meant, that she would start using the woman's bathroom, etc etc. For the most part everyone was like ok why are we even having these meetings and making a big deal about her, then there were a few ignorant people that made their comments and I made sure to try to educate them. I even asked her to come up to my department to introduce herself, and she was very open to answering anyone's curiosity questions.

"Hi Gigi, it good that you not do it when you not feel ready as this will change forever. I am from Thailand and work in plastic and medical in Thailand. I don't know which Dr, you went to... As thailand for surgery that will be under GA you should have it done in hospital not at clinic if you are went to clinic, some surgeon will have their consultation at the clinic and have surgery in private hospital and the service quite good. :) 
Also most surgeon who work with foreign client many of them have very good English. You don't even have to call them, all you need is sending them email, but for SRS it is required face to face consultation.. also first thing before the procedure start on discussion, our partner surgeon always ask for the letter from your psychologist. I work with many surgeon in Thailand.. And if you have surgeon done in The place like Bumrungrad or BDMS hospital group there is nothing to complain. There is few specialist in Bangkok who perform in hospital and also in Phuket.  
In Thailand if you do surgery under GA it will required a night stay in hospital, except you went to dodgy clinic.... and I dont recommend to do that.  Also here if you do surgery in hospital you will be ask to pay for your surgery before you going to surgery, full amount there is no down payment. :)

After use on cis women they've altered it to fit the needs of trans women. This technique completely eliminates issues such as lack of depth, self lubrication and life long dilation. Peritoneum tissue is sensitive to hormonal influences, during the healing process it stabilizes the vaginal cavity and changes its characteristics to those of biological vaginal mucosa.

"I'm happy that you didn't go through with it when you weren't comfortable and I think it was the right decision for sure. However, with serious subjects like this, I always wish you would stray from the click bait or misleading title. Because this isn't your SRS story. You even said it at the end. You don't know what that is going to look like for you. But misleading titles like this make people expect to learn about something and then to have you say just kidding I didn't do it. It's an informative storytime I just wish it wasn't a misleading title. I hope you take your time and go through with it if and when you are ready and have all your support system there with you.

"Bi means- being attracted to both men and women- trans persons are men and women so that‚Äôs not on the table it‚Äôs a given. There are so many layers. Pan finally gave people who felt this way something to hold. I‚Äôm not gay, I‚Äôm not a lesbian, I‚Äôm not bi. I would always be asked if I was Bi and the answer was always no. If you identify as any of those things and don‚Äôt meet that mold it‚Äôs perfectly ok. But the term Pan gave me a freedom and joy I never knew I had. It‚Äôs not an attack on Bi people- it‚Äôs a freedom for pan people. Everything finally made sense.

So pretty much if we‚Äôre looking at it technically in a religious strict kind of narrow minded point of you. You were born male so you were attracted to men that made you gay now you identify as female but in some peoples eyes you‚Äôre still male dating a female so that would make you straight? Or bisexual or pansexual who knows but nevertheless I look at you as a female I feel that I‚Äôm going to respect that and identify you as what you identify as. Because to me that‚Äôs a respect thing and I see you as a female. Because if I look at you as a male it just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me it doesn‚Äôt feel right to me. And other people I don‚Äôt know I can‚Äôt speak for them but at the end of the day it is your life.. xo,Ugz_4UC9KWioU1_FUNl4AaABAg,0,0,2021-04-11T20:52:29Z,2
We really don‚Äôt care what you do in your bed at night or What or who you identifiers. At the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt pay my bills I can care less as long as you stick in reality and just know that everybody is treated equally when we cross over as long as you know that I don‚Äôt care what you do with your personal life because that‚Äôs your personal life you know what I‚Äôm saying we live in at a time in era where everybody‚Äôs excepted give or take you know some small towns but just don‚Äôt go to the small town so you know I‚Äôm saying.

"I identify as Bi but I know that technically that I would be more pansexual. I am attracted to people regardless of gender. But I grew up in a small town and didn't know about pansexual (until I moved away) so I identified with Bi because it was the closest thing. It's easier for me because I dont have to explain bisexuality to small town people who have limited knowledge on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.

"i honestly think pansexuality is the highest form of love. loving someone for them. when i met my partner we were both straight, then as friends we came out as bi to one another. later on we started dating and half a year through i came out as pansexual and later that week she did also. My partner now identifys as nonbinary so They/them and her educating me on her feelings opened me up and made me realise i feel the same way. When u mention your partners soul, thats how my partner and i think. she could be in any body and i would love her and same goes for me. thats why over these year it doesnt matter what we want to label ourselves or how we want to present ourselves we love the person beneath all of that.

"I identify as bisexual when it comes to labels I use and it's what i'm most comfortable with however, my attraction or ability to fall in love with someone definitely falls into the pansexual label but I guess I just haven't reached the point in my life where I really identify myself as pan? IDK how to explain it but when I hear 'pansexual' or I say to myself 'I am pansexual' I just don't feel anything. But I also feel like bisexual doesn't fully encompass who I am either. I'm going into my early 20's so I'm still young and not too worried about it but it is confusing and still something I struggle with so this is comforting to see someone who embraces sexuality and identity as a journey.",UgweIU-9pznhGYKLISl4AaABAg,1,2,2021-04-09T22:10:16Z,2

it can be so hard to make decisions based solely off what you think is going to make yourself happy without worrying about how your decision might look to other people, but in the end i know i'm going to feel so much better knowing that i did something with the one goal of making myself happy and proud to be who i am.

Seeing so much overwhelming support for Gigi and so little hate for her coming out as Pan makes my heart happy.
It's nice to see so much acceptance, especially when I've been so discouraged. It let's me know there's a lot less hatred towards it than I had thought.
Pansexual is the one label that's felt Right for me to have, and I'm still coming to terms with it but overall I'm happy to finally have something I can identify as and be like yeah, that 100% fits.

It is so fascinating how our body works and how technology is so advanced that people are able to get biologically for masculine or feminine! I genuinely found it so interesting. And the fact that someone (a transgender person) already went through what both a male feels and what a female feels biologically, and then you have the privilege to compare it cause you actually lived both‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so amazing!

"1. Your body did not ‚Äústop producing testosterone entirely‚Äù (like 0 nm of it), it just dropped to around as low a level as a female‚Äôs after you took blockers. The surgery doesn‚Äôt stop testosterone production in the body entirely, either. 
2. You weren‚Äôt getting PMS, since you cannot and will never be able to menstruate. That‚Äôs just flat out misinformation. The change in your emotional sensitivity changed because of the Estrogen (which makes humans more emotional in general since it affects theneurotransmitter systems in hormone such as serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in your brain).

"Dear Mathilda , I always love watching your videos. I'm a trans woman myself , 26 years old , have been on a regular dose of hormones from 19 to 21 and then I was forced by my family to switch to a low dose of HRT. I have been on low dose of HRT ever since. I'm 26 now , regularly get male fail , grew my hair out and was forced by my family to put social transition off. Now it has taken its toll on my mental health. I have a good job , I just finished a Ph.D. but I am not where I want to be. I realised a couple years ago that I need to go all the way to be happy with myself , just like you. You are one of the few trans women Youtubers I can relate to because I'm a straight trans woman myself , just like you. I am an outlier because most of us who knew as children are already fully transitioned for a long time at my age , so I am sad for all these years that I lost but better late than never. I hold hope because I have seen lots of successful transitions from women who transitioned after age 20 and I have good ingredients to work with : I'm 5 feet 5""6 and have a naturally feminine voice already. Just like you I want breast augmentation and SRS. I am most scared of dating post op. I am scared how a straight cis man will react when we hit it off and I will have to tell him that I had a male gender marker on my passport ID until the latter half of my 20s. I relate so much to you because we are around the same age and just like you I am a very chatty person who can go on and on for hours talking :D 
I also am very open about myself .
I love how society is becoming so much more tolerant towards girls like us as of lately.
I still have a long road to go but channels like yours give me hope for my future.
Much love and keep up the good work ü•∞",UgxwGCHEHSkUtz91boV4AaABAg,0,16,2022-03-31T23:37:51Z,2

Who knew that one day people would actually adopt the procedure that came from a pedophile Dr. Who did experiments on children . Especially since it turned out to be such a disaster. He was born and the Dr. Botched his circumcision and the Dr told his parents it's nurture not nature and he had a twin brother so making him a girl would be a perfect test . Well he ended up making them sleep together and he recorded it . The boy found out about what happened to him around age 14 and said he always knew he was a boy and change his name back to the original and started over as a true boy . Years later he killed himself and a while after that his twin killed himself too. The Dr also did other sick and twisted stuff on kids but it has nothing to do with transgender so I guess nature has something to do with it and a lot of people are now detrasisioning so if you want to be another gender be sure you really want it  and I would try everything else possible before you permanently mess around with your body.,UgxHbTAO3xQnONghLrt4AaABAg,0,0,2021-11-06T14:41:11Z,2

"I fear that while trying to portray your experience as transparent you neglect to inform the viewer on the full risks of what you're doing to yourself and your body. You're not telling the full story, and portraying it from the perspective of almost pseudo encouragement by saying it was the answer to your dismorphia. This video could easily mislead and harm children and naive adults, please reconsider your approach. Your complaints are about your innate masculine features and by complaining about what the therapy did in a damaging way, it insinuates how that damage helped correct your look to be more feminine. Not everyone will have the same feminizing effects taking hormone therapy, some men might just get male pattern baldness and more visceral fat, some men might end up losing the cartilage inbetween their bones. Just because you ended up getting fat in ""all the right places"" for your goals doesn't mean that will happen to all. To pretend that the side effects of your treatment happened as they should and that all hormone replacement and therapy will lead to desired results is a lie at best, and intentionally misleading at worst.

You're pretending that the few things you do complain about are the biggest risks, yet you refrain from sharing any other traumatic responses to hormone therapy like astigmatism, infertility, bone density degregation, increase in cancer risk, damaged immune system, hypo/hyper thyroidism and blood disease.

Like so many others in this community, your explanation of your therapy is completely focused on the visual and cosmetic, rather than the intrinsic and internal affects done to you. You're playing a game with your words, and while you may not intend it, these are the consequences. You are not a medical doctor, nor are you qualified to talk about your ""experience"" in an educational way. Your ""honesty"" is harmful.

"I am a Christian. A Man of Christ, and biblical doctrine.

Jesus once said that if it were not for a whore who helped a fleet of Christians escape the wrath of a tyrant who was killing all Christians or Jews that stowed these two men away, than there wouldnt be much of a Church today.

He basically meant that discrimination is not a thing in his life.

With that being said.

Personal preferences are a direct result of standards that are enforced and the way that they are enforced be it good (functional) standards... or bad (dysfunctional) standards have a great impact on how a person interprets themselves and everyone else around them.

Its not all that clear if what you have done to yourself is wrong....

However, I think that in a since now that you are infact a woman, there is nothing wrong with being a woman.

I think what you have done is forgivable, it does not seem there is anything against this so long as you take responsibility for yourself the way that you are now.

I still think that our points of views are often a result of how standards are imposed over us.

Like for example.

I had a very hard headed Christian family whom I dont think are very Christ like.

Their very deceitful hypocrites who are very proud and shallow who love their comfort more than God.

They themselves are unforgiving...

I was always small, weak, and silly.

As a boy, this made very narrow minded people view me as being too much like a girl.

Even I believe that I would have fit in better as a girl.

My personality was always hyper sun shine happy and sinsitive and weak...

But, I recognized myself as a boy...

It was the rest of the world that beat in the idea that Im not man enough to be a man...

If that wasnt bad enough, I was molested as a small boy by an older boy.

I felt further and further feminised.

I dont feel what you feel exactly....

I feel like my body isnt man enough or beautiful enough for attracting woman.

I feel beside myself in my own skin.

And everyones Idea of the word Man is so steriotypical.

Im a Man, not a God.

I bleed, I bend, I break, Im not invencible...

Sometimes, because of all the pressure...

I just wish I was a woman just for a little while....

So I can be loved or ignored and people would expect less of me...

Id rather be the supporting nurturing character not the lead honcho who carries the whole world on his shoulders....

Everything is so heavy to be a man....

And Im so small....

And Im just that piece that just doesnt fit in all the gooves just right...

I think your pretty and if thats the direction you want to go in, I wont judge...

You look extremely attractive and your true to yourself.

Its not like your Gay.

Your a straight woman...

You have all the right parts and your body is clearly a womans body....

I accept you the way you are.

There is no reversing it so you may as well just own it.... Its who you are...

I dont think Jesus hates you...

I think he feels youve corrected it one way or another...

After all... he said if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out...

Clearly your body was causing you to sin...

So, you plucked it out...

You made a correction.

Your lovable, and sweet.

I like you.",UgzTzkpfMgKzCMTp3P14AaABAg,1,1,2021-09-25T16:39:34Z,2

"As an older women who would like to have a small amount of hormone replacement to feel better but am warned about all the potential dangerous side effects of doing so, I find it strange that doctors are  giving trans people massive doses of the opposite gender's hormone.  I know that too much testosterone can cause cardiac issues and sudden heart attacks.  They warn me about blood clots and strokes with estrogen and progesterone.   While I fully support a person's right to choose which gender they identify with, striving to be 100% male or female using hormone replacement is dangerous.   I also wonder why the medical community denies millions of women hormone replacement while young men can get massive doses of estrogen and progesterone.  The Women's Health Initiative of 1985 saved the insurance business millions or billions of dollars by declaring hormone therapy for women was dangerous.  Here we are 35 years later, this debunked, yet doctors still cling to antiquated research results.",UgxQtkjYQxH1J4qcI3p4AaABAg,2,0,2021-08-28T13:33:00Z,2

( sorry for all the questions, I am so curious and I am planning on going through hormone therapy or contraceptive pill to stabilise my cycle...I find it very hard to live with it)",Ugw0vGUotS4pqAyowZh4AaABAg,0,1,2021-05-08T17:40:51Z,2

Shots and patches from drs that still give em are the worst of em all. My dr only  gives me the tablet form and highly believes its the best and should be the only option. 
Tablets go under the tounge and are absorbed sublingually. I take 4 2 mg tablets of estridal under the tounge everyday. You absorbe the most Estrogen this way and its the safest method.

"Sorry, but your voice does change. The older you are the more it changes. Going from MtF, estrogen actually thins out the muscles. Your vocal cords are muscles. And as you age as a male you are exposing yourself to testosterone even longer. So yes, your voice does change. I'm 46 and have been on HRTs for a year and my voice has gotten higher. Not quite to a female voice but definitely more androgynous.",UgyfzLR4ZE_JY5A9YON4AaABAg,1,0,2021-01-05T10:04:25Z,2

"It's interesting that transgender women are becoming more feminine than the original woman though I am a little too old to consider anything but living my hermit lifestyle though still, it intrigues me.  Now if you can leave out certain traits of the original woman as you evolve such as looking at men as atm machines aka disposable, actually caring about men, constant cheating, constant upgrades, controlling behavior, among other things this world will end up a much better place.",Ugyq3fMF1fAaR_aFwoV4AaABAg,0,0,2021-01-01T13:55:11Z,2

"does being on hormones for the rest of our life, reassessing your cosmetic features and changing how you dress really help with the feeling of being who you want to be? I guess what i'm asking, do you really have to do all these irreversible unnatural things to your body to really feel the transition? Could people have had sex changing procedures long ago or is this a new thing people just do now  because it's more readily available. This isn't a transphobe comment moreso i'm just concerned how far people will go with it you know?

"So, I can't obviously speak for everyone, but the thing you say at 2:50 : Where I work most females are either as tall as me or taller (and I am 5ft 6.9"", which is the average height for females seen in 2018) and I have gone through boy puberty fully.
I've actually had some people (men and women, though it's ""funnier"" when women ask it when they are already outside if the average height range seen in most females) ask me if I would not like to be a little bit taller because ""well, I mean, you are not like, supertall"" (Dutch people are among the tallest in the world, so that might be one of the reasons for asking this).
And I have also had people who are confused, which, most of the time people tend to be just for someone being transgender, but because they don't get how I managed to stay short.
The point I'm trying to make: try to keep biological diversity in the back of your head when you think about this.
(This also goes out to people who like to place certain ""biological traits"" usually observed mostly in men under an insane magnifying glass when they meet someone who they know is a transfemale and like to emphasize all the things ""that make that you can tell she was born male"", because even if someone is slender while tall and born female and identifies with the sex assigned at birth, you will hear absolutely no one about someone's height in the way you can hear people discuss someone's height when being a transfemale).",UgzjYHW2nx-TCqwRthN4AaABAg,0,0,2020-12-05T20:48:12Z,2

Everyone has estrogen it's just biological females produce more than males but a trans person must also take something else to block the testosterone unless they get their balls removed.

"I do believe both male and female still need both hormones to maintain a stable balance and growth development. Female still need a small amount of testosterone for health and immunity, even brain development.

"You were still growing at 18... I stopped growing taller when I was like 14 :(. And I had like way more testosterone than most guys when I was growing up lol. Honestly though, a lot of stuff I used to attribute to testosterone, might actually have been early signs of Graves Disease: Like being able to lose weight really easily without exercising much, being exhausted all the time without really doing anything, hot flashes, feeling like I had a fever when I didn't(kinda like a longer hot flash lol), aches and pains, extreme anxiety, excessive and rapid hair growth, shaky hands(could also be from working out, but also a sign of hyperthyroid), sudden depression and other mood swings for no apparent reason...

Ive felt very little physical change in my musculature, a little on my chest, and none on my hips. So, everyone is different, yes, but because you were able to start when you were still IN puberty, you're IMMENSELY better off.

I hate myself everyday for not seeking help when I was younger, Because now i‚Äôm stuck with such severe gender dysphoria and anxiety that I just wanna jump out the window, And it has only been made worse after I came out because now i‚Äôm stuck between two worlds.

When the body doesn't produces hormones and you stop them, it may be like a menopause in the beginning.

HRT doesn't work for everyone in the same way.. I started HRT in my 20's back in the late 1990's and have had little to no physical effects from it.. However it did help me mentally cope with being trans just physically I got no response from it.. Over the years I have been to three different Endo's and they really don't know why.. They just remind me that everyone reacts differently to HRT.. At first I was on Premerin - Spirno then later Estradiol - Spirno - Progestrone.. Done pills.. patches.. injections.. Sometimes I think my body is just missing something that makes it responsive to HRT.. However as I said it has helped me a lot mentally which is why I have chosen to stay with it.,UgxD8X7SUYVaEVJDqRp4AaABAg,1,16,2020-06-06T11:04:08Z,2

"A few things about the voice: people going on testosterone (mostly female-to-male trans people) will experience significant changes to their voice. You can also have VFS, vocal feminization surgery. Essentially, they tighten up your vocal canal and this makes your voice resonate at a higher frequency. Your voice will be very raspy initially, and you won't know how you'll sound for quite a while, but after a few weeks you'll sound as if you never went through the male puberty at all.",UgwFcyTlVWPJupET8414AaABAg,3,0,2020-05-20T04:55:31Z,2

PMS i think is not the correct term since you obviously can nit menustrate .Hormones influence mood for sure.
It must be difficult and yet exciting since you obviously wanted to be female .

You can't go through PMS and menopause if never had a period in your life. What you are experienced is simply a change in hormone levels and temporary imbalance. There are a lot of different types of hormones and all of them can cause mood swings. PMS is premenstrual syndrome and there are A LOT of physical symptoms. The mood swings are just a drop in the ocean. Don't say that you had PMS because you didn't have it and it sounds like your making fun of those that really go through PMS EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

Only you can know what emotional changes resulted from your hormone changes but I thought it might interest someone to know did estrogen triggers the release of a hormone called prolactin it results in some breast growth is caused by some medications for psychiatric conditions and other things even in cis men in addition to causing lactation in pregnant women it causes the production of tears in the tear glands so the amount of tears available for a man to cry and thus the physical threshold required to trigger pure release is higher this is one of the reasons I assume it sometimes when people with strong doses of female hormones such as women who are pregnant will sometimes say things like I don't even know why I'm crying not to say that their emotions are in anyway invalid,UgwnCfmSchN0zs5MQ3J4AaABAg,0,0,2020-03-20T22:12:45Z,2

"I'm a newbie trans who's FtM. I came here mostly out of curiosity, and to educate myself, but now I can't stop thinking about how frustrating being trans is. I'm hourglass shaped, have very full perfectly shaped breasts, my voice literally has not changed whatsoever from childhood and is super soft and high pitched even by female standards- I have everything girls see as desirable and before I knew I was trans, no one understood how I could possibly have such intense body image issues especially since pre-puberty, I didn't give a single damn about how I looked. Now I just look at my perfectly healthy beautiful female body and wish it was given to someone it fit and could keep it exactly the way it is without feeling so horrible all the time. I almost feel bad for ruining it, especially since it's so futile I know I probably won't ever be comfortable in my own skin, because the one thing hormones don't help an 18 years old with is height and I'm stuck being 4'8"" my entire life.",UgxJSeZtPu89gmytPzx4AaABAg,6,13,2020-02-24T08:09:16Z,2

It's something I badly wish I could do as well, I want to transition also (mtf), but if you read my post in the other video, you'll know I believe it's a big challenge for me, maybe impossible, esp since I don't want to come out as trans to friends/family.

"I don't normally interact, i just silently double tap your beautiful compositions and colors. but this time the way you feel people think of you and the way i as a follower think of you are so entirely different that i need to speak up. You are one of the most beautiful women on my following list. But you also have a way with color, with photography, with editing... not just a beautiful face but a beautiful mind which creates magic wherever she goes. A mind which produces images that i save and seriously analyze to understand how they look so pleasant. A mind which inspires me. When i was listening to you in the above video, sweety i thought it makes sense in a way. What i mean is that your mind creates harmony and beauty in everything it touches. It makes sense because your appearance is created by that very same beautiful mind. This is why you are so beautiful. Your looks and your accomplishments are not a random jackpot. You are your own design. And you inspire thousands to imagine just like you do. You use your image, your creation on ig to open the door to the cosmos of your beautiful mind. Part of the world is ugly, the part that makes you cry. Because oh honey, the other part sees you with your mind's eye, exactly the way you recreated yourself, not purely as a woman, not as a man, not as a transgender individual.
