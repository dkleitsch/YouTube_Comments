1,"It‚Äôs so odd to me how people have to label things so much now.  I came out as gay, but after that I feel like everything‚Äôs else was just ‚Ä¶ well ‚Ä¶ me.  I‚Äôm a little NB, I‚Äôm a little pan, I‚Äôm a little poly‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt feel the need to tell everyone about it and label it. It seems restrictive and silly for me now to announce these things now.  You‚Äôre right.   Don‚Äôt feel like you need to come out every time some feelings change.  They‚Äôre just you.  I think it‚Äôs a point that comes when you‚Äôre happy with yourself and love you too.  Just my feelings on it now. I‚Äôm me and I don‚Äôt need to define that for you.  xo",UgxQiEdEGYCqI_CvoId4AaABAg,0,0,2022-05-06T16:09:34Z,none

514,So pretty much if we‚Äôre looking at it technically in a religious strict kind of narrow minded point of you. You were born male so you were attracted to men that made you gay now you identify as female but in some peoples eyes you‚Äôre still male dating a female so that would make you straight? Or bisexual or pansexual who knows but nevertheless I look at you as a female I feel that I‚Äôm going to respect that and identify you as what you identify as. Because to me that‚Äôs a respect thing and I see you as a female. Because if I look at you as a male it just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me it doesn‚Äôt feel right to me. And other people I don‚Äôt know I can‚Äôt speak for them but at the end of the day it is your life.. xo,Ugz_4UC9KWioU1_FUNl4AaABAg,0,0,2021-04-11T20:52:29Z,none

My partner now identifys as nonbinary so They/them and her educating me on her feelings opened me up and made me realise i feel the same way. When u mention your partners soul, thats how my partner and i think. she could be in any body and i would love her and same goes for me. thats why over these year it doesnt matter what we want to label ourselves or how we want to present ourselves we love the person beneath all of that.
