201,"I had GCS in Thailand in 2014 and I love the result!  But the trip was excruciating.  Short version;  I went by myself, my girlfriend dumped me by text the day before my surgery, the nurses at the hospital WITHHELD MY MORPHINE, I started having hallucinations when they sent me back to my hotel, the person responsible for getting me to the airport at 2am for my flight home to California FORGOT me and could not be reached,  I had to jog through the HUGE Bangkok airport to just barely make my plane, I was prescribed NO painkillers for the 18 hour trip home, I got thrown out of the restroom in Japan during a layover because I am trans, and I had 3 gross and painful infections when I finally got back home.  Would I do it again?  YES!!!  I cried so hard when I came out of surgery that my doctor broke down as well.  It was the best day of my life.

216,"I'm curious what it was that made you think that you needed the bottom surgery. I've looked at the bit of statistics that i can find and there are tons of males that are attracted to mtf trans , but very , very few are interested in a mtf transgirl  that has had the surgery. I    know a fair amount of males who are very trans attracted , but all of them are totally turned off by the bottom surgery. So if any trans girl is getting the surgery to get guys it seems to be a counter productive surgery to get. On the other hand if it is just for their own personal mental needs to feel more female , i'm also curious how that makes one feel more female. And i mean this sincerely , can this be explained to me. To me one's genitalia is not the deal maker for being female. So i personally don't see the need to take such a huge risk and perhaps mutilating oneself. I'm glad you did this video and hope that you perhaps follow up by doing more on this subject and perhaps talk to other transgirl's to explore their thoughts on the matter and perhaps identify what drives someone to take such a drastic measure. But most of all is it really necessary and why is the such dysphoria over genitals which are something that should give pleasure and not mental anguish. This to me is one of the two main problems for transwomen. The other being how to make life easier for males who are trans attracted to admit their attraction. If it was easier for them then that would also solve huge issues for transwomen.",UgxWuqG4Atg3pg5JjqZ4AaABAg,0,0,2019-07-16T03:39:36Z,none

I will let you in to a secret. GRS was hard to get done yrs ago when i did mine over 3 decades ago there was a much stricter criteria. Lots of us who did GRS many decades ago. Did so then some of stayed around a few yrs to help other following behind us the same as other had before us, Then disappeared in to the woodwork and got on with our lives as woman.   Nowadays lots live to be trans and never move on. You will never get a true rate of success and regret because lots go unseen.  They fixed their problem and moved on. Which was the whole point in the surgery.  I recently had a 3hr conversation with police officers at my home. The 1st thing i told them is you do not have to feel like your stepping on eggshells around me.   I'm not part of the new wave trans movement. Who will go apeshit if a wrong word or phrase is used.  I think that's why we chatted so long as they had lots of question. They did ask me if i would come talk to the police force and educate them on a side of being Transexul they had not encounted before.  I explained i would rather not and gave my reason why.  I personally feel there will be more regretting surgery now than those from decades ago.",UgyaB299jw4Pn2cuxHJ4AaABAg,0,2,2019-04-12T23:04:21Z,none

451,"Great video Gigiüòä Very informative with a realistic message. That's what I love about you. You've found your happiness & that's all that counts. You're no more or less of a woman with or without the bottom surgery. You still deserve the same level of love, support, kindness, & basic respect reguardless. I'm a mtf (age 22) 6 months into HRT, laser hair removal & cosmetic aspects. Not sure if I'll get full gender/sex reassignment surgery or not? Might do part 1 then wait years for part 2. Looking into it though. I'm torn it's 50/50. Deep down yes, it is something I want. But I have a bit of fear of the risks/pain. It is a scary intense surgery. It would just be for me & nobody else. Sometimes I'm like why fix something that's not broken? Plus it costs the most money. It's the only part of transitioning that's expensive. But some health insurances do cover it more & more. I'm for sure getting a bilateral orchiectomy though. Most Drs recommend it due to being on t blockers too long causes blood clots & organ failure. So once testosterone is premanently gone you can lower estrogen & go off blockers. Less risks!  It's been a long courageous battle for me but I'm on the transition path. Thanks to love & support from my wonderful family & amazing medical care. We all only live one life. It's important to be happy, healthy & comfortable in our own bodies.
The truth is there is no right or wrong way to transition. Society places labels & expectations on trans people.

I watched her go through so much research, therapy, consultations, and years of saving up money to see her dream of becoming her true self. Just going through the beginning stages, hormone therapy, implants, some minor facial reconstruction to give her face a more feminine appearance, her personality and attitude shined even brighter. I also loved the fact that she has so much support from her family friends. We also worked together, and a huge to do was made when she came back to work (after taking a mental health leave to get a handle on what she would be dealing with) meetings were held in each department with our supervisors explaining what transgender meant, that she would start using the woman's bathroom, etc etc. For the most part everyone was like ok why are we even having these meetings and making a big deal about her, then there were a few ignorant people that made their comments and I made sure to try to educate them. I even asked her to come up to my department to introduce herself, and she was very open to answering anyone's curiosity questions.

802,"Hi Gigi, it good that you not do it when you not feel ready as this will change forever. I am from Thailand and work in plastic and medical in Thailand. I don't know which Dr, you went to... As thailand for surgery that will be under GA you should have it done in hospital not at clinic if you are went to clinic, some surgeon will have their consultation at the clinic and have surgery in private hospital and the service quite good. :) 
Also most surgeon who work with foreign client many of them have very good English. You don't even have to call them, all you need is sending them email, but for SRS it is required face to face consultation.. also first thing before the procedure start on discussion, our partner surgeon always ask for the letter from your psychologist. I work with many surgeon in Thailand.. And if you have surgeon done in The place like Bumrungrad or BDMS hospital group there is nothing to complain. There is few specialist in Bangkok who perform in hospital and also in Phuket.  
In Thailand if you do surgery under GA it will required a night stay in hospital, except you went to dodgy clinic.... and I dont recommend to do that.  Also here if you do surgery in hospital you will be ask to pay for your surgery before you going to surgery, full amount there is no down payment. :)

Peritoneum tissue is sensitive to hormonal influences, during the healing process it stabilizes the vaginal cavity and changes its characteristics to those of biological vaginal mucosa.
